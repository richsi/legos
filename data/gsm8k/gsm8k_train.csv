6392,6392,Ariana is past due on three bills. The first bill for $200 charges 10% simple interest for each overdue month and it's 2 months overdue. The second bill for $130 charges a flat $50 late fee per month and is 6 months overdue. The last bill is two months late and charges a $40 fee the first month overdue and twice that fee the second month overdue and is for $444. How much does Ariana owe in total?,"First find the monthly late fee for the first bill: $200 * 10% = $<<200*10*.01=20>>20
Then multiply that by the number of months the bill is overdue: $20/month * 2 months = $<<20*2=40>>40
Then find the total late fee for the second bill the same way: $50/month * 6 months = $<<50*6=300>>300
Then find the third bill's second late fee: 2 * $40 = $<<2*40=80>>80
Then add all the bill amounts and late fees to find the total cost: $40 + $200 + $300 + $130 + $40 + $80 + $444 = $<<40+200+300+130+40+80+444=1234>>1234

3893,3893,"Rocco stores his coins in piles of 10 coins each. He has 4 piles of quarters, 6 piles of dimes, 9 piles of nickels, and 5 piles of pennies. How much money does Rocco have?","Each pile has 10 coins, so he has:
10 * 4 * $.25 = $<<10*4*.25=10.00>>10.00 worth of quarters,
10 * 6 * $.10 = $<<10*6*.10=6.00>>6.00 worth of dimes,
10 * 9 * $.05 = $<<10*9*.05=4.50>>4.50 worth of nickels, and
10 * 5 * $.01 = $<<10*5*.01=0.50>>0.50 worth of pennies.
Altogether he has $10.00 + $6.00 + $4.50 + $0.50 = $<<10+6+4.5+0.5=21.00>>21.00

6895,6895,"John and James decided to have a dance-off.  John danced for 3 hours and then another 5 hours after taking a 1-hour break.  James danced the whole time John was dancing and resting, and then another 1/3 times more hours.  How long was their combined dancing time without including  John's break time?","John dances 3+5=<<3+5=8>>8 hours
John's total time is 3+5+1=<<3+5+1=9>>9 hours
James dances 9/3=<<9/3=3>>3 hours longer than that
So James dances 9+3=<<9+3=12>>12 hours
So the total dancing time is 8+12=<<8+12=20>>20 hours
