4146,4146,"At Roosevelt high school there are 600 students in the senior class. A fifth of the students are in the marching band. Of the students in the marching band, half of them play a brass instrument. Of the students that play a brass instrument, a fifth of them play the saxophone. Of the students that play the saxophone, a third of them play the alto saxophone. How many students play the alto saxophone?","The number of students in the marching band is 600 / 5 = <<600/5=120>>120 students
The number of students that play a brass instrument is 120 / 2 = <<120/2=60>>60 students
The number of students that play the saxophone is 60 / 5 = <<60/5=12>>12 students
The number of students that play the alto saxophone is 12 / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 students

3309,3309,"Denver uses 7 pieces of wood for each birdhouse and he pays $1.50 for each piece of wood. If he makes a $5.50 profit per birdhouse, how much will Denver charge to Danny for buying two birdhouses?","The cost for making one birdhouse is $1.50 x 7 = $<<1.5*7=10.50>>10.50.
So the selling price of one birdhouse is $10.50 + $5.50 = $<<10.5+5.5=16>>16.
Thus, Denver will charge Danny $16 x 2 = $<<16*2=32>>32 for the two birdhouses.

4869,4869,Brenda catches smallpox. She has 60 blisters on each arm and 80 blisters on the rest of her body. How many blisters does she have in total?,"First find the total number of blisters on Brenda's arms: 60 blisters/arm * 2 arms = 120 blisters
Then add the blisters on the rest of her body to find the total: 120 blisters + 80 blisters = <<120+80=200>>200 blisters

1307,1307,"Sarah's age is equal to three times Mark's age minus 4. Mark is four years older than Billy. Billy is half Ana's age. If Ana will be 15 in 3 years, how old is Sarah?","First figure out how old Ana is right now by subtracting 3 from 15: 15 - 3 = <<15-3=12>>12
Next, figure out how old Billy is by dividing Ana's age by 2: 12 / 2 = <<6=6>>6
Now figure out how old Mark is by adding 4 to Billy's age: 6 + 4 = <<6+4=10>>10
Now, to figure out Sarah's age, first multiply Mark's age by 3: 10 * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30
Finally, subtract 4 from triple Mark's age to find Sarah's age: 30 - 4 = <<30-4=26>>26

5031,5031,"Gretchen read that you should spend 10 minutes walking for every 90 minutes you spend sitting. If Gretchen spends 6 hours working at her desk, how long will she spend walking?","First find the total number of minutes Gretchen spends sitting at her desk: 6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<6*60=360>>360 minutes
Then divide this amount by 90 minutes to find how many walking breaks Gretchen takes: 360 minutes / 90 minutes/break = <<360/90=4>>4 breaks
Then multiply the number of breaks by the length of each break to find how long Gretchen spends walking: 4 breaks * 10 minutes/break = <<4*10=40>>40 minutes
