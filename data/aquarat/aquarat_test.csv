"Two trains under a controlled experiment begin at a speed of 100 mph in the opposite direction in a tunnel. A supersonic bee is left in the tunnel which can fly at a speed of 1000 mph. The tunnel is 200 miles long. When the trains start running on a constant speed of 100 mph, the supersonic bee starts flying from one train towards the other. As soon as the bee reaches the second train, it starts flying back towards the first train.
If the bee keeps flying to and fro in the tunnel till the trains collide, how much distance will it have covered in total?","['A)1000 miles.', 'B)2000 miles.', 'C)3000 miles.', 'D)4000 miles.', 'E)5000 miles.']","Solution:
A typical way will be to start thinking about summing up the distance that the bee will travel but that will be quite a tedious task. How about we offer you a much easy solution?
The tunnel is 200 miles long and the trains are running at as peed of 100 mph which means that they will collide exactly at the center of the tunnel and seeking their speed, they will collide after an hour.
Now consider the bee which is flying at a speed of 1000 mph and will keep flying till the train collides. As calculated, it will keep flying for an hour which means the distance that it will cover is 1000 miles.

He took one of those piles along with the extra biscuit and hid them. He then gathered the 4 remaining piles into a big pile, woke up the second person and went to sleep. Each of the other 3 persons did the same one by one i.e. divided the big pile into 5 equal piles and found one extra biscuit. Each hid one of the piles along with the extra biscuit and gathered the remaining 4 piles into a big pile. If N>1000, what could be the least value of N?","['A)1249', 'B)1246', 'C)1202', 'D)1000', 'E)None of these']","Explanation :
Let, each equal part is x and N be the total number of biscuits.
Thus, N=5x+1.
A took (x+1) biscuit.
Now 4x is of the form 5y+1 then x must be in the form 5z+4
⇒4(5z+4)=5y+1
⇒y=4z+3 and x=5z+4
The ratio of number of biscuits that A and B took is
[(5z+4)+1]:[(4z+3)+1]=5:4.
So, we can say that any two successive persons A, B, C and D take coins in the ratio of 5:4
Let the number of biscuits that A, B, C and D took be a, b, c and d respectively.
=>a:b=b:c=c:d=5:4.
=>a:b:c:d=125:100:80:64.
=>a=125k.
=>x=125k−1 and N=5x+1=625k−4.
As, N>1000, the least value of N is when k=2.
=>N= 1246.

When he came back to India, he played another two test matches of two innings each and scored at an average of 55 runs. For the innings in England and in India taken together, he has improved his average by 2 runs over the matches played in England. Find the number of innings played in England.","['A)12', 'B)13', 'C)14', 'D)15', 'E)16']","Let the number of innings played in England be x.

The initial solution most people will think of is to use the fastest person as an usher to guide everyone across. How long would that take? 10 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 2 = 21 minutes. Is that it? No. That would make this question too simple even as a warm up question.
Let's brainstorm a little further. To reduce the amount of time, we should find a way for 10 and 7 to go together. If they cross together, then we need one of them to come back to get the others. That would not be ideal. How do we get around that? Maybe we can have 1 waiting on the other side to bring the torch back. Ahaa, we are getting closer. The fastest way to get 1 across and be back is to use 2 to usher 1 across. So let's put all this together.
1 and 2 go cross
2 comes back
7 and 10 go across
1 comes back
1 and 2 go across (done)

"One day in December 2015, three 2-digit prime numbers A, B and C, were
given to three members of a High School math team: Ashley, Beth, and Caitlin (respectively).
They had this conversation:
Ashley: \If you two add your numbers, we get precisely today's date!""
Beth: \If you two add your numbers, we get my birthday this month, which was before today.""
Caitlin: \If you two add your numbers, we get my birthday this month, which is after today.""
What number did Caitlin get?","['A)11', 'B)13', 'C)17', 'D)19', 'E)23']","The numbers A, B, C belong a priori in the set f11; 13; 17; 19g|Note that the
addition of any of these two 2-digit prime numbers cannot be greater than or equal to 30,
which places a strong restriction on the greatest of the three numbers: this must be at most
19. These are the only valid additions of any two numbers on that set:
11 + 11 = 22, 11 + 13 = 24, 11 + 17 = 29, 11 + 19 = 30, 13 + 13 = 26, 13 + 17 = 30
Note in particular the strict inequalities placed on the addition of any of these two numbers:
22 _<A + C < B + C < A + B _<30
Since C < B, there are only two possibilities for B+C at this point: B = 13,C = 11,B+C =
24, or B = 17,C = 11,B + C = 29.

"When Mary paints a house, it takes her 4 hours. When Lisa joins Mary, and they work together, it takes them only 3 hours to paint a house of the same size. How long would it take for Lisa to paint a house of the same size by herself?","['A)5 hr', 'B)6 hr', 'C)7 hr', 'D)12 hr', 'E)20 hr']","Here, the rate equation becomes:
(# of houses) = (painting rate) x (time)
When Mary paints a house, it takes her 4 hours. Thus, (1 house) = (Mary’s rate) x (4 hr), so her rate is 1/4.
When Mary & Lisa paint together, it takes 3 hrs. Thus, (1 house) = (combined rate) x (3 hr) and the combined rate = 1/3.
To find a combined rate, we add individual rates.
(combined rate) = (Mary’s rate) + (Lisa’s rate)
1/3 = 1/4 + (Lisa’s rate)
(Lisa’s rate) = 1/3-1/4=1/3*4/4-1/4*3/3=4/12-3/12=1/12
Lisa’s rate is 1/12 of a house every hour, or in other words, 1 house in 12 hrs. Thus, it would take her 12 hours to paint a house of the same size.
