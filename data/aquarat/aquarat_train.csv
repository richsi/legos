91194,A starts walking at 4 kmph and 4 hours after his start B starts cycling at 10 kmph. After how much distance will B catch up with A,"['A)26.2 km', 'B)25.7 km', 'C)23.2 km', 'D)26.67 km', 'E)None of these']","Explanation:
Distance travelled by each of them is to be made equal.
=> Distance travelled walking = Distance covered cycling.
Let after 4 hours of walking, A walk for x hours more before B catches up with him.
=> Distance = Speed * Time
(4+x)4 = 10x
x = 8/3
Therefore, It takes B 8/3 hours to catch up with A. Distance: 8/3 x 10 = 80/3 km = 26.67

60188,"John went to a shop and bought things worth Rs. 25, out of which 30 Paise went on sales tax on taxable purchases. If the tax rate was 6%, then what was the cost of the tax free items?","['A)17', 'B)18', 'C)19.7', 'D)21', 'E)27']","Total cost of the items he purchased = Rs.25
Given that out of this Rs.25, 30 Paise is given as tax
=> Total tax incurred = 30 Paise = Rs.30/100
Let the cost of the tax free items = x
Given that tax rate = 6%
∴ (25−30/100−x)6/100 = 30/100
⇒ 6(25 −0.3 −x) = 30
⇒ (25 − 0.3 − x) = 5
⇒ x = 25 − 0.3 − 5 = 19.7
