20758,"In a certain animal population, for each of the first 3 months of life, the probability that an animal will die during that month is 1/4. For a group of 200 newborn members of the population, approximately how many would be expected to survive the first 3 months of life?","['A)40', 'B)46', 'C)52', 'D)62', 'E)85']","The probability of survival for each of the first 3 months of life is 1-1/4=3/4, so of 200 newborn 200*3/4 *3/4*3/4=~85 is expected to survive.

91194,A starts walking at 4 kmph and 4 hours after his start B starts cycling at 10 kmph. After how much distance will B catch up with A,"['A)26.2 km', 'B)25.7 km', 'C)23.2 km', 'D)26.67 km', 'E)None of these']","Explanation:
Distance travelled by each of them is to be made equal.
=> Distance travelled walking = Distance covered cycling.
Let after 4 hours of walking, A walk for x hours more before B catches up with him.
=> Distance = Speed * Time
(4+x)4 = 10x
x = 8/3
Therefore, It takes B 8/3 hours to catch up with A. Distance: 8/3 x 10 = 80/3 km = 26.67

92153,Rs.8000 become Rs.9261 in a certain interval of time at the rate of 5% per annum of C.I. Find the time?,"['A)10years', 'B)12 years', 'C)5 years', 'D)3 years', 'E)24 years']","Explanation:
9261 = 8000(21/20)N
(21/20)3 = (21/20)N => N = 3 years
