3920,what is the yearly amortization rate related to other intangibles?,33.3%,"goodwill is assigned to one or more reporting segments on the date of acquisition . we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting segments to its carrying value , including the associated goodwill . to determine the fair values , we use the market approach based on comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of businesses and the income approach based on estimated discounted future cash flows . our cash flow assumptions consider historical and forecasted revenue , operating costs and other relevant factors . we amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and review them for impairment whenever an impairment indicator exists . we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of our long-lived assets , including our intangible assets may not be recoverable . when such events or changes in circumstances occur , we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows . if the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets , we recognize an impairment loss based on any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets . we did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2012 , 2011 or 2010 . our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 to 13 years . amortization is based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset will be consumed . the weighted average useful lives of our intangible assets was as follows : weighted average useful life ( years ) . software development costs capitalization of software development costs for software to be sold , leased , or otherwise marketed begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility , which is generally the completion of a working prototype that has been certified as having no critical bugs and is a release candidate . amortization begins once the software is ready for its intended use , generally based on the pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed . to date , software development costs incurred between completion of a working prototype and general availability of the related product have not been material . internal use software we capitalize costs associated with customized internal-use software systems that have reached the application development stage . such capitalized costs include external direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the applications and payroll and payroll-related expenses for employees , who are directly associated with the development of the applications . capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases at the point in which the project is substantially complete and is ready for its intended purpose . income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes . under this method , income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year . in addition , deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities , and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards . we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not . table of contents adobe systems incorporated notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) ."," | weighted averageuseful life ( years ) |

5574,"what is the total long-term debt in billions of dollars for citigroup , cgmhi , cfi and citigroup 2019s subsidiaries at december 31 , 2008?",359.6,"sources of liquidity primary sources of liquidity for citigroup and its principal subsidiaries include : 2022 deposits ; 2022 collateralized financing transactions ; 2022 senior and subordinated debt ; 2022 commercial paper ; 2022 trust preferred and preferred securities ; and 2022 purchased/wholesale funds . citigroup 2019s funding sources are diversified across funding types and geography , a benefit of its global franchise . funding for citigroup and its major operating subsidiaries includes a geographically diverse retail and corporate deposit base of $ 774.2 billion . these deposits are diversified across products and regions , with approximately two-thirds of them outside of the u.s . this diversification provides the company with an important , stable and low-cost source of funding . a significant portion of these deposits has been , and is expected to be , long-term and stable , and are considered to be core . there are qualitative as well as quantitative assessments that determine the company 2019s calculation of core deposits . the first step in this process is a qualitative assessment of the deposits . for example , as a result of the company 2019s qualitative analysis certain deposits with wholesale funding characteristics are excluded from consideration as core . deposits that qualify under the company 2019s qualitative assessments are then subjected to quantitative analysis . excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and the sale of our retail banking operations in germany during the year ending december 31 , 2008 , the company 2019s deposit base remained stable . on a volume basis , deposit increases were noted in transaction services , u.s . retail banking and smith barney . this was partially offset by the company 2019s decision to reduce deposits considered wholesale funding , consistent with the company 2019s de-leveraging efforts , and declines in international consumer banking and the private bank . citigroup and its subsidiaries have historically had a significant presence in the global capital markets . the company 2019s capital markets funding activities have been primarily undertaken by two legal entities : ( i ) citigroup inc. , which issues long-term debt , medium-term notes , trust preferred securities , and preferred and common stock ; and ( ii ) citigroup funding inc . ( cfi ) , a first-tier subsidiary of citigroup , which issues commercial paper , medium-term notes and structured equity-linked and credit-linked notes , all of which are guaranteed by citigroup . other significant elements of long- term debt on the consolidated balance sheet include collateralized advances from the federal home loan bank system , long-term debt related to the consolidation of icg 2019s structured investment vehicles , asset-backed outstandings , and certain borrowings of foreign subsidiaries . each of citigroup 2019s major operating subsidiaries finances its operations on a basis consistent with its capitalization , regulatory structure and the environment in which it operates . particular attention is paid to those businesses that for tax , sovereign risk , or regulatory reasons cannot be freely and readily funded in the international markets . citigroup 2019s borrowings have historically been diversified by geography , investor , instrument and currency . decisions regarding the ultimate currency and interest rate profile of liquidity generated through these borrowings can be separated from the actual issuance through the use of derivative instruments . citigroup is a provider of liquidity facilities to the commercial paper programs of the two primary credit card securitization trusts with which it transacts . citigroup may also provide other types of support to the trusts . as a result of the recent economic downturn , its impact on the cashflows of the trusts , and in response to credit rating agency reviews of the trusts , the company increased the credit enhancement in the omni trust , and plans to provide additional enhancement to the master trust ( see note 23 to consolidated financial statements on page 175 for a further discussion ) . this support preserves investor sponsorship of our card securitization franchise , an important source of liquidity . banking subsidiaries there are various legal limitations on the ability of citigroup 2019s subsidiary depository institutions to extend credit , pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to citigroup and its non-bank subsidiaries . the approval of the office of the comptroller of the currency , in the case of national banks , or the office of thrift supervision , in the case of federal savings banks , is required if total dividends declared in any calendar year exceed amounts specified by the applicable agency 2019s regulations . state-chartered depository institutions are subject to dividend limitations imposed by applicable state law . in determining the declaration of dividends , each depository institution must also consider its effect on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements , as well as policy statements of the federal regulatory agencies that indicate that banking organizations should generally pay dividends out of current operating earnings . non-banking subsidiaries citigroup also receives dividends from its non-bank subsidiaries . these non-bank subsidiaries are generally not subject to regulatory restrictions on dividends . however , as discussed in 201ccapital resources and liquidity 201d on page 94 , the ability of cgmhi to declare dividends can be restricted by capital considerations of its broker-dealer subsidiaries . cgmhi 2019s consolidated balance sheet is liquid , with the vast majority of its assets consisting of marketable securities and collateralized short-term financing agreements arising from securities transactions . cgmhi monitors and evaluates the adequacy of its capital and borrowing base on a daily basis to maintain liquidity and to ensure that its capital base supports the regulatory capital requirements of its subsidiaries . some of citigroup 2019s non-bank subsidiaries , including cgmhi , have credit facilities with citigroup 2019s subsidiary depository institutions , including citibank , n.a . borrowings under these facilities must be secured in accordance with section 23a of the federal reserve act . there are various legal restrictions on the extent to which a bank holding company and certain of its non-bank subsidiaries can borrow or obtain credit from citigroup 2019s subsidiary depository institutions or engage in certain other transactions with them . in general , these restrictions require that transactions be on arm 2019s length terms and be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral . see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements on page 169 . at december 31 , 2008 , long-term debt and commercial paper outstanding for citigroup , cgmhi , cfi and citigroup 2019s subsidiaries were as follows : in billions of dollars citigroup parent company cgmhi ( 2 ) citigroup funding inc .

6207,what was the percentage change in equipment rents payable from 2011 to 2012?,6%,"the analysis of our depreciation studies . changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively . under group depreciation , the historical cost ( net of salvage ) of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized . the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using ( i ) inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ( ii ) the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies . the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes . because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired , we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate . in addition , we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient ( or in excess ) of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies . any deficiency ( or excess ) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets . for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business , a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions : ( i ) is unusual , ( ii ) is material in amount , and ( iii ) varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies . a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations . when we purchase an asset , we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use . however , many of our assets are self-constructed . a large portion of our capital expenditures is for replacement of existing track assets and other road properties , which is typically performed by our employees , and for track line expansion and other capacity projects . costs that are directly attributable to capital projects ( including overhead costs ) are capitalized . direct costs that are capitalized as part of self- constructed assets include material , labor , and work equipment . indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset . general and administrative expenditures are expensed as incurred . normal repairs and maintenance , including rail grinding , are also expensed as incurred , while costs incurred that extend the useful life of an asset , improve the safety of our operations or improve operating efficiency are capitalized . these costs are allocated using appropriate statistical bases . total expense for repairs and maintenance incurred was $ 2.1 billion for 2012 , $ 2.2 billion for 2011 , and $ 2.0 billion for 2010 . assets held under capital leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease . amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease . 12 . accounts payable and other current liabilities dec . 31 , dec . 31 , millions 2012 2011 .","millions | dec . 31 2012 | dec . 312011 |
