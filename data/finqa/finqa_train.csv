3920,what is the yearly amortization rate related to other intangibles?,33.3%,"goodwill is assigned to one or more reporting segments on the date of acquisition . we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting segments to its carrying value , including the associated goodwill . to determine the fair values , we use the market approach based on comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of businesses and the income approach based on estimated discounted future cash flows . our cash flow assumptions consider historical and forecasted revenue , operating costs and other relevant factors . we amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and review them for impairment whenever an impairment indicator exists . we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of our long-lived assets , including our intangible assets may not be recoverable . when such events or changes in circumstances occur , we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows . if the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets , we recognize an impairment loss based on any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets . we did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2012 , 2011 or 2010 . our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 to 13 years . amortization is based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset will be consumed . the weighted average useful lives of our intangible assets was as follows : weighted average useful life ( years ) . software development costs capitalization of software development costs for software to be sold , leased , or otherwise marketed begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility , which is generally the completion of a working prototype that has been certified as having no critical bugs and is a release candidate . amortization begins once the software is ready for its intended use , generally based on the pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed . to date , software development costs incurred between completion of a working prototype and general availability of the related product have not been material . internal use software we capitalize costs associated with customized internal-use software systems that have reached the application development stage . such capitalized costs include external direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the applications and payroll and payroll-related expenses for employees , who are directly associated with the development of the applications . capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases at the point in which the project is substantially complete and is ready for its intended purpose . income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes . under this method , income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year . in addition , deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities , and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards . we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not . table of contents adobe systems incorporated notes to consolidated financial statements ( continued ) ."," | weighted averageuseful life ( years ) |

5574,"what is the total long-term debt in billions of dollars for citigroup , cgmhi , cfi and citigroup 2019s subsidiaries at december 31 , 2008?",359.6,"sources of liquidity primary sources of liquidity for citigroup and its principal subsidiaries include : 2022 deposits ; 2022 collateralized financing transactions ; 2022 senior and subordinated debt ; 2022 commercial paper ; 2022 trust preferred and preferred securities ; and 2022 purchased/wholesale funds . citigroup 2019s funding sources are diversified across funding types and geography , a benefit of its global franchise . funding for citigroup and its major operating subsidiaries includes a geographically diverse retail and corporate deposit base of $ 774.2 billion . these deposits are diversified across products and regions , with approximately two-thirds of them outside of the u.s . this diversification provides the company with an important , stable and low-cost source of funding . a significant portion of these deposits has been , and is expected to be , long-term and stable , and are considered to be core . there are qualitative as well as quantitative assessments that determine the company 2019s calculation of core deposits . the first step in this process is a qualitative assessment of the deposits . for example , as a result of the company 2019s qualitative analysis certain deposits with wholesale funding characteristics are excluded from consideration as core . deposits that qualify under the company 2019s qualitative assessments are then subjected to quantitative analysis . excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and the sale of our retail banking operations in germany during the year ending december 31 , 2008 , the company 2019s deposit base remained stable . on a volume basis , deposit increases were noted in transaction services , u.s . retail banking and smith barney . this was partially offset by the company 2019s decision to reduce deposits considered wholesale funding , consistent with the company 2019s de-leveraging efforts , and declines in international consumer banking and the private bank . citigroup and its subsidiaries have historically had a significant presence in the global capital markets . the company 2019s capital markets funding activities have been primarily undertaken by two legal entities : ( i ) citigroup inc. , which issues long-term debt , medium-term notes , trust preferred securities , and preferred and common stock ; and ( ii ) citigroup funding inc . ( cfi ) , a first-tier subsidiary of citigroup , which issues commercial paper , medium-term notes and structured equity-linked and credit-linked notes , all of which are guaranteed by citigroup . other significant elements of long- term debt on the consolidated balance sheet include collateralized advances from the federal home loan bank system , long-term debt related to the consolidation of icg 2019s structured investment vehicles , asset-backed outstandings , and certain borrowings of foreign subsidiaries . each of citigroup 2019s major operating subsidiaries finances its operations on a basis consistent with its capitalization , regulatory structure and the environment in which it operates . particular attention is paid to those businesses that for tax , sovereign risk , or regulatory reasons cannot be freely and readily funded in the international markets . citigroup 2019s borrowings have historically been diversified by geography , investor , instrument and currency . decisions regarding the ultimate currency and interest rate profile of liquidity generated through these borrowings can be separated from the actual issuance through the use of derivative instruments . citigroup is a provider of liquidity facilities to the commercial paper programs of the two primary credit card securitization trusts with which it transacts . citigroup may also provide other types of support to the trusts . as a result of the recent economic downturn , its impact on the cashflows of the trusts , and in response to credit rating agency reviews of the trusts , the company increased the credit enhancement in the omni trust , and plans to provide additional enhancement to the master trust ( see note 23 to consolidated financial statements on page 175 for a further discussion ) . this support preserves investor sponsorship of our card securitization franchise , an important source of liquidity . banking subsidiaries there are various legal limitations on the ability of citigroup 2019s subsidiary depository institutions to extend credit , pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to citigroup and its non-bank subsidiaries . the approval of the office of the comptroller of the currency , in the case of national banks , or the office of thrift supervision , in the case of federal savings banks , is required if total dividends declared in any calendar year exceed amounts specified by the applicable agency 2019s regulations . state-chartered depository institutions are subject to dividend limitations imposed by applicable state law . in determining the declaration of dividends , each depository institution must also consider its effect on applicable risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements , as well as policy statements of the federal regulatory agencies that indicate that banking organizations should generally pay dividends out of current operating earnings . non-banking subsidiaries citigroup also receives dividends from its non-bank subsidiaries . these non-bank subsidiaries are generally not subject to regulatory restrictions on dividends . however , as discussed in 201ccapital resources and liquidity 201d on page 94 , the ability of cgmhi to declare dividends can be restricted by capital considerations of its broker-dealer subsidiaries . cgmhi 2019s consolidated balance sheet is liquid , with the vast majority of its assets consisting of marketable securities and collateralized short-term financing agreements arising from securities transactions . cgmhi monitors and evaluates the adequacy of its capital and borrowing base on a daily basis to maintain liquidity and to ensure that its capital base supports the regulatory capital requirements of its subsidiaries . some of citigroup 2019s non-bank subsidiaries , including cgmhi , have credit facilities with citigroup 2019s subsidiary depository institutions , including citibank , n.a . borrowings under these facilities must be secured in accordance with section 23a of the federal reserve act . there are various legal restrictions on the extent to which a bank holding company and certain of its non-bank subsidiaries can borrow or obtain credit from citigroup 2019s subsidiary depository institutions or engage in certain other transactions with them . in general , these restrictions require that transactions be on arm 2019s length terms and be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral . see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements on page 169 . at december 31 , 2008 , long-term debt and commercial paper outstanding for citigroup , cgmhi , cfi and citigroup 2019s subsidiaries were as follows : in billions of dollars citigroup parent company cgmhi ( 2 ) citigroup funding inc .

( 1 ) ""owned and leased capability"" is the dependable load carrying capability as demonstrated under actual operating conditions based on the primary fuel ( assuming no curtailments ) that each station was designed to utilize . entergy's load and capacity projections are reviewed periodically to assess the need and timing for additional generating capacity and interconnections . these reviews consider existing and projected demand , the availability and price of power , the location of new loads , and economy . peak load in the u.s . utility service territory is typically around 21000 mw , with minimum load typically around 9000 mw . allowing for an adequate reserve margin , entergy has been short approximately 3000 mw during the summer peak load period . in addition to its net short position at summer peak , entergy considers its generation in three categories : ( 1 ) baseload ( e.g . coal and nuclear ) ; ( 2 ) load-following ( e.g . combined cycle gas-fired ) ; and ( 3 ) peaking . the relative supply and demand for these categories of generation vary by region of the entergy system . for example , the north end of its system has more baseload coal and nuclear generation than regional demand requires , but is short load-following or intermediate generation . in the south end of the entergy system , load would be more effectively served if gas- fired intermediate resources already in place were supplemented with additional solid fuel baseload generation. .","company | owned and leased capability mw ( 1 ) total | owned and leased capability mw ( 1 ) gas/oil | owned and leased capability mw ( 1 ) nuclear | owned and leased capability mw ( 1 ) coal | owned and leased capability mw ( 1 ) hydro |

1800,what is the growth rate of operating expenses from 2009 to 2010?,-5.3%,"operating profit for the segment decreased by 1% ( 1 % ) in 2010 compared to 2009 . for the year , operating profit declines in defense more than offset an increase in civil , while operating profit at intelligence essentially was unchanged . the $ 27 million decrease in operating profit at defense primarily was attributable to a decrease in the level of favorable performance adjustments on mission and combat systems activities in 2010 . the $ 19 million increase in civil principally was due to higher volume on enterprise civilian services . operating profit for the segment decreased by 3% ( 3 % ) in 2009 compared to 2008 . operating profit declines in civil and intelligence partially were offset by growth in defense . the decrease of $ 29 million in civil 2019s operating profit primarily was attributable to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on enterprise civilian services programs in 2009 compared to 2008 . the decrease in operating profit of $ 27 million at intelligence mainly was due to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on security solution activities in 2009 compared to 2008 . the increase in defense 2019s operating profit of $ 29 million mainly was due to volume and improved performance in mission and combat systems . the decrease in backlog during 2010 compared to 2009 mainly was due to higher sales volume on enterprise civilian service programs at civil , including volume associated with the dris 2010 program , and mission and combat system programs at defense . backlog decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to u.s . government 2019s exercise of the termination for convenience clause on the tsat mission operations system ( tmos ) contract at defense , which resulted in a $ 1.6 billion reduction in orders . this decline more than offset increased orders on enterprise civilian services programs at civil . we expect is&gs will experience a low single digit percentage decrease in sales for 2011 as compared to 2010 . this decline primarily is due to completion of most of the work associated with the dris 2010 program . operating profit in 2011 is expected to decline in relationship to the decline in sales volume , while operating margins are expected to be comparable between the years . space systems our space systems business segment is engaged in the design , research and development , engineering , and production of satellites , strategic and defensive missile systems , and space transportation systems , including activities related to the planned replacement of the space shuttle . government satellite programs include the advanced extremely high frequency ( aehf ) system , the mobile user objective system ( muos ) , the global positioning satellite iii ( gps iii ) system , the space-based infrared system ( sbirs ) , and the geostationary operational environmental satellite r-series ( goes-r ) . strategic and missile defense programs include the targets and countermeasures program and the fleet ballistic missile program . space transportation includes the nasa orion program and , through ownership interests in two joint ventures , expendable launch services ( united launch alliance , or ula ) and space shuttle processing activities for the u.s . government ( united space alliance , or usa ) . the space shuttle is expected to complete its final flight mission in 2011 and our involvement with its launch and processing activities will end at that time . space systems 2019 operating results included the following : ( in millions ) 2010 2009 2008 . net sales for space systems decreased by 5% ( 5 % ) in 2010 compared to 2009 . sales declined in all three lines of business during the year . the $ 253 million decrease in space transportation principally was due to lower volume on the space shuttle external tank , commercial launch vehicle activity and other human space flight programs , which partially were offset by higher volume on the orion program . there were no commercial launches in 2010 compared to one commercial launch in 2009 . strategic & defensive missile systems ( s&dms ) sales declined $ 147 million principally due to lower volume on defensive missile programs . the $ 8 million sales decline in satellites primarily was attributable to lower volume on commercial satellites , which partially were offset by higher volume on government satellite activities . there was one commercial satellite delivery in 2010 and one commercial satellite delivery in 2009 . net sales for space systems increased 8% ( 8 % ) in 2009 compared to 2008 . during the year , sales growth at satellites and space transportation offset a decline in s&dms . the sales growth of $ 707 million in satellites was due to higher volume in government satellite activities , which partially was offset by lower volume in commercial satellite activities . there was one commercial satellite delivery in 2009 and two deliveries in 2008 . the increase in sales of $ 21 million in space transportation primarily was due to higher volume on the orion program , which more than offset a decline in the space shuttle 2019s external tank program . there was one commercial launch in both 2009 and 2008 . s&dms 2019 sales decreased by $ 102 million mainly due to lower volume on defensive missile programs , which more than offset growth in strategic missile programs. .","( in millions ) | 2010 | 2009 | 2008 |
