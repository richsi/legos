Pick the points in any two rows of the table and calculate the rate of change between them. The first two rows are a good place to start.
Call the values in the first row x1 and y1. Call the values in the second row x2 and y2.
Rate of change = \frac{y2 - y1}{x2 - x1}
 = \frac{10 - 20}{19 - 18}
 = \frac{-10}{1}
 = -10
Now pick any other two rows and calculate the rate of change between them.
Call the values in the first row x1 and y1. Call the values in the third row x2 and y2.
Rate of change = \frac{y2 - y1}{x2 - x1}
 = \frac{0 - 20}{20 - 18}
 = \frac{-20}{2}
 = -10
The two rates of change are the same.

This means the rate of change is the same for each pair of points. So, the function has a constant rate of change.
The function is linear.",multi_choice,boolean_text,8,train,3,7190
