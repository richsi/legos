(PROMPT START)
You are an advanced reasoning agent that can add, edit, or remove rules from your existing rule set, based on new insights or expansions.

Here is your existing rule set:
RULE 1: Break the question into its fundamental components by isolating key sub-questions and identifying the underlying assumptions or facts required to solve each step.
RULE 2: When decomposing a question, identify the key elements of the question and the facts provided to ensure Use the provided facts to build logical connections between each step, validating that every inference aligns with the available evidence and the overall question context.
RULE 3: Ensure that the final answer is consistent with the step-by-step decomposition by cross-verifying each reasoning step, confirming that all parts contribute coherently to the final conclusion.

Now, you are given mathematical tasks from the GSM8K dataset. Each task has:
• A Question
• An Answer

Each new rule should be:

1. Clear and concise, focusing on how to break down the question and verify the final answer.
2. Helping in ensuring the reasoning steps are valid and that the final answer is accurate.

Now, you will be provided examples to base these rules off of.
Examples: 
Question: At Roosevelt high school there are 600 students in the senior class. A fifth of the students are in the marching band. Of the students in the marching band, half of them play a brass instrument. Of the students that play a brass instrument, a fifth of them play the saxophone. Of the students that play the saxophone, a third of them play the alto saxophone. How many students play the alto saxophone?
The number of students in the marching band is 600 / 5 = 120 students
The number of students that play a brass instrument is 120 / 2 = 60 students
The number of students that play the saxophone is 60 / 5 = 12 students
The number of students that play the alto saxophone is 12 / 3 = 4 students
Final Answer: 4



Question: Denver uses 7 pieces of wood for each birdhouse and he pays $1.50 for each piece of wood. If he makes a $5.50 profit per birdhouse, how much will Denver charge to Danny for buying two birdhouses?
The cost for making one birdhouse is $1.50 x 7 = $10.50.
So the selling price of one birdhouse is $10.50 + $5.50 = $16.
Thus, Denver will charge Danny $16 x 2 = $32 for the two birdhouses.
Final Answer: 32



Question: Brenda catches smallpox. She has 60 blisters on each arm and 80 blisters on the rest of her body. How many blisters does she have in total?
First find the total number of blisters on Brenda's arms: 60 blisters/arm * 2 arms = 120 blisters
Then add the blisters on the rest of her body to find the total: 120 blisters + 80 blisters = 200 blisters
Final Answer: 200



Question: Sarah's age is equal to three times Mark's age minus 4. Mark is four years older than Billy. Billy is half Ana's age. If Ana will be 15 in 3 years, how old is Sarah?
First figure out how old Ana is right now by subtracting 3 from 15: 15 - 3 = 12
Next, figure out how old Billy is by dividing Ana's age by 2: 12 / 2 = 6
Now figure out how old Mark is by adding 4 to Billy's age: 6 + 4 = 10
Now, to figure out Sarah's age, first multiply Mark's age by 3: 10 * 3 = 30
Finally, subtract 4 from triple Mark's age to find Sarah's age: 30 - 4 = 26
Final Answer: 26



Question: Gretchen read that you should spend 10 minutes walking for every 90 minutes you spend sitting. If Gretchen spends 6 hours working at her desk, how long will she spend walking?
First find the total number of minutes Gretchen spends sitting at her desk: 6 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 360 minutes
Then divide this amount by 90 minutes to find how many walking breaks Gretchen takes: 360 minutes / 90 minutes/break = 4 breaks
Then multiply the number of breaks by the length of each break to find how long Gretchen spends walking: 4 breaks * 10 minutes/break = 40 minutes
Final Answer: 40



Your job is to generate exactly five concise new insights (i.e., RULES) that would help an agent correctly answer any complex GSM8K question. 
Each insight should be a clear, high-level guideline that will aid in answering the example questions. Ensure that there are no empty rules.
Make sure each rule is presented as a single line or sentence and that it complements (or updates) the existing RULES above. Avoid repetition.
(PROMPT END)

RULE 4: Identify the key variables and their relationships in the problem, and use them to construct a logical sequence of steps that leads to the final answer.
RULE 5: When working with ratios or proportions, use the reciprocal of the given ratio to simplify calculations and ensure accuracy.
RULE 6: When working with fractions, use the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators to simplify calculations and ensure accuracy.
RULE 7: When working with percentages, use the inverse operation to solve for the unknown value and ensure accuracy.
RULE 8: When working with equations, use algebraic manipulation to isolate the variable and ensure accuracy.
