You are an advanced reasoning agent that can add, edit, or remove rules from your existing rule set, based on new insights or expansions.

Here is your existing rule set:
RULE 1: Break the question into its fundamental components by isolating key sub-questions and identifying the underlying assumptions or facts required to solve each step.
RULE 2: When decomposing a question, identify the key elements of the question and the facts provided to ensure Use the provided facts to build logical connections between each step, validating that every inference aligns with the available evidence and the overall question context.
RULE 3: Ensure that the final answer is consistent with the step-by-step decomposition by cross-verifying each reasoning step, confirming that all parts contribute coherently to the final conclusion.

Now, you are given mathematical tasks from the GSM8K dataset. Each task has:
• A Question
• An Answer

Each new rule should be:

1. Clear and concise, focusing on how to break down the question and verify the final answer.
2. Helping in ensuring the reasoning steps are valid and that the final answer is accurate.

Now, you will be provided examples to base these rules off of.
Examples: 
Question: An adult panda can eat 138 pounds of bamboo each day. A baby panda can eat 50 pounds of bamboo a day.  How many pounds of bamboo will the pandas eat in a week?
An adult panda will eat 138 pounds of bamboo * 7 days = 966 pounds.
A baby panda will eat 50 pounds * 7 days = 350 pounds.
Total the pandas will eat 966 pounds + 350 = 1316 pounds of bamboo.
Final Answer: 1316



Question: Ariana is past due on three bills. The first bill for $200 charges 10% simple interest for each overdue month and it's 2 months overdue. The second bill for $130 charges a flat $50 late fee per month and is 6 months overdue. The last bill is two months late and charges a $40 fee the first month overdue and twice that fee the second month overdue and is for $444. How much does Ariana owe in total?
First find the monthly late fee for the first bill: $200 * 10% = $20
Then multiply that by the number of months the bill is overdue: $20/month * 2 months = $40
Then find the total late fee for the second bill the same way: $50/month * 6 months = $300
Then find the third bill's second late fee: 2 * $40 = $80
Then add all the bill amounts and late fees to find the total cost: $40 + $200 + $300 + $130 + $40 + $80 + $444 = $1234
Final Answer: 1234



Question: Rocco stores his coins in piles of 10 coins each. He has 4 piles of quarters, 6 piles of dimes, 9 piles of nickels, and 5 piles of pennies. How much money does Rocco have?
Each pile has 10 coins, so he has:
10 * 4 * $.25 = $10.00 worth of quarters,
10 * 6 * $.10 = $6.00 worth of dimes,
10 * 9 * $.05 = $4.50 worth of nickels, and
10 * 5 * $.01 = $0.50 worth of pennies.
Altogether he has $10.00 + $6.00 + $4.50 + $0.50 = $21.00
Final Answer: 21



Question: Tom plants a tree that is 1 year old and 5 feet tall.  It gains 3 feet per year.  How old is it when it is 23 feet tall?
It has grown 23-5=18 feet
So it is 18/3=6 years older
That means it is 6+1=7 years old
Final Answer: 7



Question: John and James decided to have a dance-off.  John danced for 3 hours and then another 5 hours after taking a 1-hour break.  James danced the whole time John was dancing and resting, and then another 1/3 times more hours.  How long was their combined dancing time without including  John's break time?
John dances 3+5=8 hours
John's total time is 3+5+1=9 hours
James dances 9/3=3 hours longer than that
So James dances 9+3=12 hours
So the total dancing time is 8+12=20 hours
Final Answer: 20



Your job is to generate exactly five concise new insights (i.e., RULES) that would help an agent correctly answer any complex GSM8K question. 
Each insight should be a clear, high-level guideline that will aid in answering the example questions. Ensure that there are no empty rules.
Make sure each rule is presented as a single line or sentence and that it complements (or updates) the existing RULES above. Avoid repetition.
