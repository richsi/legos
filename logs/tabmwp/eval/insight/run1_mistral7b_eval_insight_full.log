(PROMPT START)
Follow each of the given examples by using its Table to find the answer for its Question with the reasoning after Answer: and final answer after The answer is:.

Now, you will be provided with extracted insights and rules to help you answer the evaluation questions.
1. Identify the context of the question to determine the relevant data and relationships.
2. Use logical deduction to draw inferences from the available data and relationships.
3. Validate the inferences by checking if they align with the provided evidence and the overall question context.
4. Cross-verify each reasoning step to ensure that all parts contribute coherently to the final conclusion.
5. Use the provided facts to build logical connections between each step, validating that every inference aligns with the available evidence and the overall question context.
6. Ensure that the final answer is consistent with the step-by-step decomposition by cross-verifying each reasoning step, confirming that all parts contribute coherently to the final conclusion.
7. Identify the key elements of the question and the facts provided to ensure that the reasoning process is accurate and complete.
8. Use the provided context to identify any missing or ambiguous information that may affect the reasoning process.
9. Use the provided context to identify any potential biases or assumptions that may affect the reasoning process.
10. Use the provided context to identify any relevant patterns or trends that may affect the reasoning process.

Following the given examples, generate step by step reasoning in 'Answer' and generate 'Final Answer' for the below question.
Table: 
Day | Number of cookies
Friday | 163
Saturday | 281
Sunday | 263
Question: Hannah baked cookies each day for a bake sale. How many more cookies did Hannah bake on Saturday than on Sunday?

(PROMPT END)
Answer:
1. Identify the context of the question to determine the relevant data and relationships.
The context of the question is that Hannah baked cookies each day for a bake sale. The relevant data are the number of cookies baked on each day. The relationship between the days is that they are consecutive days.
2. Use logical deduction to draw inferences from the available data and relationships.
Hannah baked more cookies on Saturday than on Sunday. To determine the difference, we need to subtract the number of cookies baked on Sunday from the number of cookies baked on Saturday.
3. Validate the inferences by checking if they align with the provided evidence and the overall question context.
The inference that Hannah baked more cookies on Saturday than on Sunday is supported by the available data. The difference between the number of cookies baked on Saturday and Sunday is 281 - 263 = 18.
4. Cross-verify each reasoning step to ensure that all parts contribute coherently to the final conclusion.
The number of cookies baked on Saturday is greater than the number of cookies baked on Sunday. The difference between the two is 18. Therefore, Hannah baked 18 more cookies on Saturday than on Sunday.
Final Answer: Hannah baked 18 more cookies on Saturday than on Sunday.

Table: 
Name | Number of coins
Braden | 76
Camilla | 94
Rick | 86
Mary | 84
Hector | 80
Devin | 83
Emily | 82
Avery | 87
Question: Some friends discussed the sizes of their coin collections. What is the mean of the numbers?

(PROMPT END)
Answer:
1. The context of the question is the number of coins each friend has.
2. We can use logical deduction to draw inferences from the available data and relationships.
3. The mean of the numbers is calculated by adding up all the numbers and dividing by the total number of friends.
4. We can validate the inferences by checking if they align with the provided evidence and the overall question context.
5. The mean of the numbers is calculated as follows: (76 + 94 + 86 + 84 + 80 + 83 + 82 + 87) / 8 = 84.
6. Cross-verifying each reasoning step, we can confirm that all parts contribute coherently to the final conclusion.
7. The key elements of the question are the number of coins each friend has and the calculation of the mean.
8. We can identify any missing or ambiguous information that may affect the reasoning process. There is no missing or ambiguous information provided in the table.
9. We can identify any potential biases or assumptions that may affect the reasoning process. There are no biases or assumptions provided in the table.
10. We can identify any relevant patterns or trends that may affect the reasoning process. There are no patterns or trends provided in the table.

Final Answer: The mean of the numbers is 84.
