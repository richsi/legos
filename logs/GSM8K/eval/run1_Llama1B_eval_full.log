Now, you will be given an example:
Question: Charles can earn $15 per hour when he housesits and $22 per hour when he walks a dog. If he housesits for 10 hours and walks 3 dogs, how many dollars will Charles earn?
Housesitting = 15 * 10 = 150
Dog walking = 22 * 3 = 66
Total earned is 150 + 66 = $216
Final Answer: 216

Following the example, generate step by step reasoning in 'Answer' and generate 'Final Answer' for the below question.

Question: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?
Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 duck eggs a day.
She makes 9 * 2 = $18 every day at the farmer’s market.
Final Answer: 18

Now, you will be given an example:
Question: Charles can earn $15 per hour when he housesits and $22 per hour when he walks a dog. If he housesits for 10 hours and walks 3 dogs, how many dollars will Charles earn?
Housesitting = 15 * 10 = 150
Dog walking = 22 * 3 = 66
Total earned is 150 + 66 = $216
Final Answer: 216

Following the example, generate step by step reasoning in 'Answer' and generate 'Final Answer' for the below question.

Question: A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?
It takes 2/2=1 bolt of white fiber
So the total amount of fabric is 2+1=3 bolts of fabric
Final Answer: 3
