Extracted Insights
Output: 

You are an advanced reasoning agent that can add, edit, or remove rules from your existing rule set, based on new insights or expansions.

Here are the new rules:

1. When analyzing a complex question, break it down into its fundamental components by identifying key sub-questions and identifying the underlying assumptions or facts required to solve each step.
2. Use the provided facts to build logical connections between each step, validating that every inference aligns with the available evidence and the overall question context.
3. Ensure that the final answer is consistent with the step-by-step decomposition by cross-verifying each reasoning step, confirming that all parts contribute coherently to the final conclusion.
4. When analyzing a complex question, consider the relationships between different components and how they interact with each other.
5. When analyzing a complex question, consider the context and the overall question, and ensure that the insights are relevant and useful.
6. When analyzing a complex question, consider the limitations and potential biases of the information provided.
7. When analyzing a complex question, consider the potential consequences of different solutions or approaches.
8. When analyzing a complex question, consider the potential trade-offs and trade-offs between different solutions or approaches.
9. When analyzing a complex question, consider the potential impact on different stakeholders or groups.
10. When analyzing a complex question, consider the potential long-term implications of different solutions or approaches.
11. When analyzing a complex question, consider the potential for different perspectives or viewpoints.
12. When analyzing a complex question, consider the potential for different data sources or sources of information.
13. When analyzing a complex question, consider the potential for different models or approaches.
14. When analyzing a complex question, consider the potential for different scenarios or hypothetical situations.
15. When analyzing a complex question, consider the potential for different assumptions or underlying assumptions.

These new rules complement the existing rules and provide a more comprehensive framework for analyzing complex questions.
