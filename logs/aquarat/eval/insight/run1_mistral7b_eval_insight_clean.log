Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to first convert the speed from kilometers per hour to miles per hour. We know that 1 kilometer is equal to 0.6 miles, so we can multiply the speed by 0.6 to get the speed in miles per hour.

So,
Speed in miles per hour = Speed in kilometers per hour x 0.6
= 900 x 0.6
= 540 miles per hour

Next, we need to convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per minute. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can divide the speed by 60 to get the speed in miles per minute.

So,
Speed in miles per minute = Speed in miles per hour / 60
= 540 / 60
= 9 miles per minute

Therefore, the final answer is 9 miles per minute.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided to find the length of the ship. We know that it takes 240 seconds to pass through the channel and 60 seconds to pass through the gates of the port.

First, we need to convert the time taken to pass through the channel from seconds to meters. We know that 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds, so:

240 seconds = 240/60 = 4 meters

Next, we need to use the fact that the ship takes 4 meters to pass through the channel to find its length. We know that the channel is 750 meters long, so:

Length of ship = Length of channel / Time taken to pass through channel
Length of ship = 750 meters / 4 meters
Length of ship = 187.5 meters

Therefore, the length of the ship is 187.5 meters.

Final answer: 187.5 meters.
