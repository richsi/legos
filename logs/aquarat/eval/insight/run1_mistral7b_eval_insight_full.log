Question: A ship is leaving a port. It takes 240 seconds to passes through a 750m channel to get to the port gates, and takes 60 seconds to pass through the gates of the port. What is its length?
Options:
A)100 m
B)150 m
C)200 m
D)250 m
E)300 m

(PROMPT END)
Final answer: E) 300 m

Explanation:

RULE 4: Identify the key elements of the question and the facts provided.

The key elements of the question are:

* The ship is leaving a port
* It takes 240 seconds to pass through a 750m channel
* It takes 60 seconds to pass through the gates of the port
* We need to find the length of the ship

The facts provided are:

* It takes 240 seconds to pass through a 750m channel
* It takes 60 seconds to pass through the gates of the port

RULE 5: Ensure that the final answer is consistent with the step-by-step reasoning by cross-referencing each step with the provided context.

The step-by-step reasoning to solve this question is as follows:

1. We know that the ship takes 240 seconds to pass through a 750m channel. We can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the speed of the ship.
2. Time = Distance / Speed
3. Time = 750m / Speed
4. Time = 240s / Speed
5. Speed = 750m / 240s = 3m/s

Now we know the speed of the ship is 3m/s. We also know that the ship takes 60 seconds to pass through the gates of the port.

1. We know that the ship takes 60 seconds to pass through the gates of the port. We can use the formula distance = speed x time to find the length of the ship.
2. Distance = Speed x Time
3. Distance = 3m/s x 60s
4. Distance = 180m

Therefore, the length of the ship is 180m.

RULE 7: Ensure that the final answer is consistent with the provided context by validating that each step in the reasoning process aligns with the available evidence and the overall question context, and that the final answer is consistent with the provided context.

The final answer is consistent with the available evidence and the overall question context. Therefore, we can conclude that 180m is the length of the ship.

Final answer: E) 300 m

Question: A travel company wants to charter a plane to the Bahamas. Chartering the plane costs $5,000. So far, 12 people have signed up for the trip. If the company charges $200 per ticket, how many more passengers must sign up for the trip before the company can make any profit on the charter?
Options:
A)7
B)9
C)13
D)27
E)45

(PROMPT END)
Final answer: E
Explanation: 

RULE 1: The key elements of the question are: the cost of chartering the plane ($5,000), the number of people who have signed up for the trip (12), and the price per ticket ($200).

RULE 2: The fact provided is the cost of the charter, which is $5,000. 

RULE 3: The fact provided is the number of people who have signed up for the trip, which is 12.

RULE 4: The fact provided is the price per ticket, which is $200.

RULE 5: To make a profit on the charter, the company needs to earn more than $5,000 from the trip. 

RULE 6: To make a profit on the charter, the company needs to earn more than $5,000 from the trip, and they need to cover the $5,000 charter cost. 

RULE 7: To make a profit on the charter, the company needs to earn more than $5,000 from the trip, they need to cover the $5,000 charter cost, and they need to earn enough money for each ticket to cover their cost and provide a profit.

RULE 8: To make a profit on the charter, the company needs to earn more than $5,000 from the trip, they need to cover the $5,000 charter cost, they need to earn enough money for each ticket to cover their cost and provide a profit, and they need to have enough passengers sign up for the trip to cover their costs and generate a profit. 
 
Therefore, 

Total cost of the trip = 12 (tickets) x $200 (per ticket) + $5,000 (charter cost) = $13,200 + $5,000 = $18,200

Number of passengers needed to break-even = Total cost of the trip / Price per ticket = $18,200 / $200 = 91

Since there are currently 12 people signed up, the company needs 8 more passengers to break-even, and 45 more passengers to make a profit.

Question: Kirk sells cars. On two sales, Kirk has received commissions of $850, and $705, and he has one additional sale pending. If Kirk is to receive an average (arithmetic mean) commission of exactly $820 on the three sales, then the third commission must be:
Options:
A)$895
B)$905
C)$910
D)$915
E)$945

(PROMPT END)
Final answer:

To solve the problem, we need to find the third commission required to achieve an average commission of $820. Let's denote the third commission as x.

There are three formulas that we can use to find x:

Formula 1: (x + 850 + 705) / 3 = 820
Formula 2: x + 705 / (1 - 0.82 / 850)
Formula 3: x = $820 x (3 + 850 / 705)

However, we can eliminate option E based on the fact that it requires an $850 commission on the third sale when in the scenario provided, Kirk made a $705 commission on the second sale, and we know that the third sale commission should not be significantly different.

Using Formula 2, we can simplify it like this:
x = $705 / (1 - 0.82 / 850)
x = $705 / (0.82 / 850)
x = $705 x (13 / 2)
x = $945

Therefore, the third commission required to achieve an average commission of $820 on the three sales is $945.

Option A: $895 is incorrect because it is less than the $820 mean commission requirements.
Option B: $905 is incorrect because it is closer to the $820 mean commission requirements but still not consistent with the $895 and $705 commission amounts already given as examples.
Option C: $910 is too close to the mean commission amount, making it unlikely that Kirk would sell the third car for a commission of $910.
Option D: $915 is too close to the mean commission amount, making it unlikely that Kirk would sell the third car for a commission of $915.

Final Answer: C) $910
