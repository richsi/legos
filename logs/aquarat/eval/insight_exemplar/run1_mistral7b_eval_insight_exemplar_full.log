Question: In a certain animal population, for each of the first 3 months of life, the probability that an animal will die during that month is 1/4. For a group of 200 newborn members of the population, approximately how many would be expected to survive the first 3 months of life?
Options:
A)40
B)46
C)52
D)62
E)85
Reasoning: The probability of survival for each of the first 3 months of life is 1-1/4=3/4, so of 200 newborn 200*3/4 *3/4*3/4=~85 is expected to survive.
Answer: E.. The correct option is E.

Question: A starts walking at 4 kmph and 4 hours after his start B starts cycling at 10 kmph. After how much distance will B catch up with A
Options:
A)26.2 km
B)25.7 km
C)23.2 km
D)26.67 km
E)None of these
Reasoning: Explanation:
Distance travelled by each of them is to be made equal.
=> Distance travelled walking = Distance covered cycling.
Let after 4 hours of walking, A walk for x hours more before B catches up with him.
=> Distance = Speed * Time
(4+x)4 = 10x
x = 8/3
Therefore, It takes B 8/3 hours to catch up with A. Distance: 8/3 x 10 = 80/3 km = 26.67
ANSWER: D. The correct option is D.

Now, you will be provided with some example questions.
Question: In a certain animal population, for each of the first 3 months of life, the probability that an animal will die during that month is 1/4. For a group of 200 newborn members of the population, approximately how many would be expected to survive the first 3 months of life?
Options:
A)40
B)46
C)52
D)62
E)85
Reasoning: The probability of survival for each of the first 3 months of life is 1-1/4=3/4, so of 200 newborn 200*3/4 *3/4*3/4=~85 is expected to survive.
Answer: E.. The correct option is E.

Question: A starts walking at 4 kmph and 4 hours after his start B starts cycling at 10 kmph. After how much distance will B catch up with A
Options:
A)26.2 km
B)25.7 km
C)23.2 km
D)26.67 km
E)None of these
Reasoning: Explanation:
Distance travelled by each of them is to be made equal.
=> Distance travelled walking = Distance covered cycling.
Let after 4 hours of walking, A walk for x hours more before B catches up with him.
=> Distance = Speed * Time
(4+x)4 = 10x
x = 8/3
Therefore, It takes B 8/3 hours to catch up with A. Distance: 8/3 x 10 = 80/3 km = 26.67
