Final answer:

To convert the speed from kilometers per hour to miles per minute, we need to use the conversion factor 1 km = 0.6 miles.

First, we need to convert the speed from kilometers per hour to miles per minute:

900 km/h * (0.6 miles/km) = 540 miles/min

Therefore, the speed of the three birds is 540 miles per minute.

Final answer:

The area of the shorter piece is 12 square feet. The area of the longer piece is 12/3 = 4 square feet. The area of the original piece is 2 x 2 = 4 square feet.

Since the area of the shorter piece is 12 square feet, the area of the longer piece is 4 square feet, and the area of the original piece is 4 square feet, we can conclude that the original piece is a rectangle with an area of 4 square feet.

Since the shorter piece is one-third of the length of the longer piece, we can write:

Length of shorter piece = 1/3 x Length of longer piece

We know that the length of the shorter piece is 12 feet, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

12 = 1/3 x Length of longer piece

Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:

36 = Length of longer piece

Therefore, the length of the original piece is:

Length of original piece = Length of shorter piece + Length of longer piece

Length of original piece = 12 + 36

Length of original piece = 48 feet

Final answer: E. The correct option is E.

Final answer:

First, we need to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle. Since the area of the triangle is 10, we can use Heron's formula to find the lengths of the sides.

Let a, b, and c be the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

We know that the area of the triangle is 10, so we can use Heron's formula to find the lengths of the sides:

s = (a + b + c) / 2

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

s = (a + b + c) / 2

s = (a + b + c) / 2

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use the Chain-of-Thought methodology. We will start by identifying the key elements of the problem and the facts provided.

1. ABC company has eight vehicles in total.
2. The company pays an average of $120 per vehicle each month in outdoor parking fees for three of its vehicles.
3. The company pays an average of $240 per vehicle overall each month for parking.

We can use the following steps to solve the problem:

Step 1: Calculate the total monthly parking fees for the three vehicles that pay outdoor parking fees.
Total monthly parking fees = Number of vehicles * Average monthly parking fee per vehicle
Total monthly parking fees = 3 * $120 = $360

Step 2: Calculate the total monthly parking fees for the five vehicles that pay garage parking fees.
Total monthly parking fees = Number of vehicles * Average monthly parking fee per vehicle
Total monthly parking fees = 5 * $240 = $1200

Step 3: Calculate the total monthly parking fees for all eight vehicles.
Total monthly parking fees = Total monthly parking fees for outdoor parking + Total monthly parking fees for garage parking
Total monthly parking fees = $360 + $1200 = $1560

Step 4: Calculate the average monthly parking fee per vehicle for all eight vehicles.
Average monthly parking fee per vehicle = Total monthly parking fees / Number of vehicles
Average monthly parking fee per vehicle = $1560 / 8 = $195

Step 5: Compare the average monthly parking fee per vehicle with the overall average monthly parking fee per vehicle.
If the average monthly parking fee per vehicle for all eight vehicles is the same as the overall average monthly parking fee per vehicle, then the company pays the same amount per month in garage parking fees for its vehicles.

Average monthly parking fee per vehicle = $195
Overall average monthly parking fee per vehicle = $240

Since the average monthly parking fee per vehicle for all eight vehicles ($195) is not the same as the overall average monthly parking fee per vehicle ($240), we need to find out how much the company pays per month in garage parking fees for its vehicles.

We can use the following steps to find out how much the company pays per month in garage parking fees for its vehicles:

Step 6: Calculate the difference between the overall average monthly parking fee per vehicle and the average monthly parking fee per vehicle for all eight vehicles.
Difference = Overall average monthly parking fee per vehicle - Average monthly parking fee per vehicle for all eight vehicles
Difference = $240 - $195 = $45

Step 7: Divide the difference by the number of vehicles that pay garage parking fees to find out how much the company pays per month in garage parking fees for each of these vehicles.
Garage parking fee per vehicle = Difference / Number of vehicles that pay garage parking fees
Garage parking fee per vehicle = $45 / 5 = $9

Therefore, the company pays $9 per month in garage parking fees for each of the five vehicles that pay garage parking fees.

Final answer: The company pays $9 per month in garage parking fees for each of the five vehicles that pay garage parking fees.

mistral7b Task 9:


Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to use the concept of evaporation and the relationship between the amount of salt and water in the solution.

First, let's calculate the initial amount of salt and water in the solution:

Initial salt concentration = 5%
Initial water concentration = 95%

Initial amount of salt = 5% of 50 litres = 2.5 litres
Initial amount of water = 95% of 50 litres = 47.5 litres

Next, we need to calculate the amount of salt and water remaining in the solution after heating:

Final salt concentration = 10%

Final amount of salt = 10% of 50 litres = 5 litres

Since the amount of salt has increased, the amount of water has decreased. We can calculate the amount of water remaining in the solution using the following formula:

Amount of water remaining = Initial amount of water - Final amount of salt

Amount of water remaining = 47.5 litres - 5 litres = 42.5 litres

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the solution after heating is 42.5 litres.

Final answer: D) 22.5 litres.

Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to use the concept of ratios. Let the amount of spirit be x and the amount of water be y. According to the problem, the ratio of spirit to water is 3:2. Therefore, we can write:

x/y = 3/2

We also know that the amount of spirit is 3 litre more than the amount of water. Therefore, we can write:

x = y + 3

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

(y + 3)/y = 3/2

Cross-multiplying, we get:

2(y + 3) = 3y

Expanding, we get:

2y + 6 = 3y

Subtracting 2y from both sides, we get:

6 = y

Therefore, the amount of water in the mixture is 6 litre. Substituting this value into the second equation, we get:

x = 6 + 3 = 9 litre

Therefore, the amount of spirit in the mixture is 9 litre.

Final answer: E. The smallest possible total value for the mutual fund is $18 million.

Explanation:

1. We know that 60 percent of the money is invested in bonds, and of that portion, 40 percent is invested in highly rated corporate bonds.
2. To find the smallest possible total value for the mutual fund, we need to assume that the remaining 40 percent of the money is invested in low-rated bonds or other assets.
3. Let's assume that the total value of the mutual fund is x dollars.
4. Then, the value of the bonds portion is 0.6x, and the value of the highly rated corporate bonds portion is 0.4 \* 0.6x = 0.24x.
5. Since at least $2.4 million in this fund is invested in highly rated corporate bonds, we have 0.24x >= 2.4 million.
6. Solving for x, we get x >= 9.6 million.
7. Therefore, the smallest possible total value for the mutual fund is $18 million.

Final answer: E. The smallest possible total value for the mutual fund is $18 million.

Final answer:

The nightly rate of the room is $68.00.

Explanation:

Let's denote the nightly rate of the room as R. The tax on the nightly rate is 0.04R. The nightly fee is $2.00, which is not subject to tax.

The total charge for a room for one night is the sum of the nightly rate, the tax, and the nightly fee:

$72.72 = R + 0.04R + $2.00

Combining the terms on the right side of the equation, we get:

$72.72 = 1.04R + $2.00

Subtracting $2.00 from both sides of the equation, we get:

$70.72 = 1.04R

Dividing both sides of the equation by 1.04, we get:

R = $68.00

Therefore, the nightly rate of the room is $68.00.

Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to follow the steps below:

1. We know that the trader bought some books for Rs 8 each.
2. We also know that the wholesaler gave 15% discount on each of the books.
3. The discount amount deducted on the bill was Rs 216.
4. To find out how many books the trader bought, we need to calculate the total cost of the books before the discount and then subtract the discount amount from it.
5. Let's assume that the trader bought x books.
6. The total cost of the books before the discount would be 8x.
7. After applying the 15% discount, the total cost of the books would be 8x * (1 - 15/100) = 6.4x.
8. We know that the discount amount deducted on the bill was Rs 216.
9. Therefore, 6.4x = 216.

Final answer: Elliot had $800 left with.

Explanation:
Elliot started with $1500. After his father gave him $600, he had $1500 + $600 = $2100. Then he bought a mobile for $400, leaving him with $2100 - $400 = $1700. Finally, he bought a laptop for $1300, leaving him with $1700 - $1300 = $400. Therefore, Elliot had $800 left with.

Final answer:

Let's start by decomposing the question:

1. We know that 6 tractors can plough the field in 4 days, and each of them ploughs 120 hectares a day. So, the total area ploughed by 6 tractors in 4 days is 6*120*4 = 2880 hectares.
2. If two of the tractors are moved to another field, then the remaining 4 tractors can plough the same field in 5 days. So, the total area ploughed by 4 tractors in 5 days is 4*120*5 = 2400 hectares.
3. Since the total area ploughed by 6 tractors in 4 days is 2880 hectares, and the total area ploughed by 4 tractors in 5 days is 2400 hectares, we can conclude that the combined work of 6 tractors in 4 days is equal to the combined work of 4 tractors in 5 days.
4. Therefore, the area ploughed by one tractor in 4 days is 2880/6 = 480 hectares.

So, the final answer is E)222.

Final answer:

The retailer makes a profit of Rs. 4.50 on the article.

Explanation:

1. The wholesaler allows a discount of 20% on the list price to the retailer. So, the retail price of the article is 80% of the list price.
2. The retailer sells at 5% below the retail price. So, the customer pays 95% of the retail price.
3. The customer pays Rs. 19 for the article.
4. To find the profit made by the retailer, we need to calculate the difference between the retail price and the cost price.
5. The retail price is 80% of the list price, which is 0.8 x Rs. 100 = Rs. 80.
6. The cost price is 95% of the retail price, which is 0.95 x Rs. 80 = Rs. 76.
7. The profit made by the retailer is the difference between the retail price and the cost price, which is Rs. 80 - Rs. 76 = Rs. 4.
8. Therefore, the retailer makes a profit of Rs. 4.50 on the article.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to find the normal speed of the car.

1. The car covers 1/2 of a journey of 100 km, which means it covers 50 km.
2. It arrives 2 hours late than its normal time, which means it takes 2 hours longer than its normal time to cover the 50 km.
3. Let's denote the normal speed of the car as x km/h. Then, the time it takes for the car to cover 50 km at its normal speed is 50/x hours.
4. Since the car takes 2 hours longer than its normal time to cover the 50 km, we can write the equation: 50/x = 50/(x-2).
5. Solving this equation, we get x = 10.

Therefore, the normal speed of the car is 10 km/h.

Final answer: The normal speed of the car is 10 km/h.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's first find the probability that a player selected at random bats left-handed:

P(left-handed) = P(left-handed and right-handed) + P(left-handed but not right-handed)

We know that 60% of players can bat both right-handed and left-handed, so:

P(left-handed and right-handed) = 0.6

Also, 1/3 of the players who bat left-handed do not bat right-handed, so:

P(left-handed but not right-handed) = 1/3 \* P(left-handed) = 1/3 \* 0.6 = 0.2

Now we can find the probability that a player selected at random bats left-handed:

P(left-handed) = 0.6 + 0.2 = 0.8

To find the probability that a player selected at random does not bat left-handed, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion again:

P(not left-handed) = P(right-handed) + P(left-handed but not right-handed) - P(left-handed and right-handed)

We know that 40% of players can only bat right-handed, so:

P(right-handed) = 0.4

Also, we found that P(left-handed but not right-handed) = 0.2, and P(left-handed and right-handed) = 0.6. So:

P(not left-handed) = 0.4 + 0.2 - 0.6 = 0.2

Therefore, the probability that a player selected at random does not bat left-handed is 20%.

Final answer: B) 20%

2. We also know that the total increase for x shares was Rs 12.50.
3. To find the number of shares purchased, we can set up an equation:
Total increase = Number of shares * Increase per share
4. Plugging in the given values, we get:
12.50 = x * 0.25
5. Solving for x, we find that x = 50.

To solve this question, we need to first understand the given information. We know that A is 30% more efficient than B. This means that for every unit of time that B takes to complete a task, A will take 70% of that time.

Let's assume that A takes 'a' days to complete the job alone. Then, working together, they will take 'a' days / 0.7 = 1.43 days.

Since we know that A can complete the job in 23 days, we can set up the following equation:

a = 23 \* 0.7 = 16.1

Therefore, working together, they will take 1.43 days / 0.7 = 2.04 days.

Loss = Selling price - Purchase price
Loss = Rs.465.50 - Rs.490
Loss = -Rs.24.50

Since the loss is negative, it means that the seller made a profit. Therefore, the loss percentage is 0%.

Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to use the concept of ratios. Let's denote the present age of Maya as M and the present age of Chhaya as C. According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 6:5 at present. Therefore, we can write:

M/C = 6/5

We also know that fifteen years from now, the ratio of their ages will be 9:8. So, we can write:

(M+15)/(C+15) = 9/8

Now, we can solve this system of equations to find Maya's present age. First, we can rewrite the first equation as:

C = M/5

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

(M+15)/(M/5+15) = 9/8

Multiplying both sides by 5, we get:

5(M+15) = 9M + 75

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

5M + 75 = 9M + 75

Subtracting 5M from both sides, we get:

0 = 4M

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

M = 0

However, this answer doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as ages cannot be zero. Therefore, we need to look for another solution.

We can rewrite the first equation as:

C = 5M/6

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

(M+15)/(5M/6+15) = 9/8

Multiplying both sides by 6, we get:

6(M+15) = 9M + 105

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

6M + 90 = 9M + 105

Subtracting 6M from both sides, we get:

30 = 15

Dividing both sides by 15, we get:

M = 2

Therefore, Maya's present age is 2 years.

Final answer: Maya's present age is 2 years.

Final answer:

Scott bought three bags of candy with 75 pieces in each one, so he has a total of 3*75 = 225 pieces of candy. He plans to divide all the candy evenly among seven friends, so each friend will get 225/7 ≈ 32.14 pieces of candy. Since Scott cannot have a fraction of a piece of candy, we can round down to 32 pieces per friend.

Scott will have 225 - (7*32) = 225 - 224 = 1 piece of candy left for himself.

Therefore, the final answer is E)1.

Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to use the given information to find the cost price of the fan. Let's start by using the information given about the loss.

If the man reduces the selling price of the fan from Rs.400 to Rs.380, his loss increases by 2%. This means that the new loss is 1.02 times the old loss.

Let's assume that the old loss is L. Then the new loss is 1.02L.

We know that the cost price of the fan is C, and the selling price is S. So, the profit made on the fan is S - C.

When the man reduces the selling price by Rs.20, the new profit is S - C - Rs.20.

We also know that the new loss is 1.02 times the old loss. So, the new loss is 1.02L.

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for C:

S - C - Rs.20 = 1.02L

We know that S = Rs.400, and the new loss is 1.02L. So, we can substitute these values into the equation:

Rs.400 - C - Rs.20 = 1.02L

Simplifying this equation, we get:

C = Rs.400 - Rs.20 - 1.02L

Now, we need to use the information given about the loss to find the value of L. We know that the old loss is L, and the new loss is 1.02L. So, we can set up another equation:

L = 1.02L

Dividing both sides of the equation by 1.02, we get:

L = 1

So, the old loss is Rs.1.

Now, we can substitute this value of L into the equation we found for C:

C = Rs.400 - Rs.20 - 1.02(1)

C = Rs.400 - Rs.20 - 1.02

C = Rs.380

So, the cost price of the fan is Rs.380.

Final answer: The cost price of the fan is Rs.380.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of units that must be sold so that the total revenue equals the total cost of production.

Let x be the number of units that must be sold.

Total cost of production = Initial investment + (Cost per unit * Number of units)
Total cost of production = 9800 + (0.65x)

Total revenue = Selling price per unit * Number of units
Total revenue = 1.20x

To find the number of units that must be sold, we need to set the total cost of production equal to the total revenue:

9800 + (0.65x) = 1.20x

Subtracting 0.65x from both sides, we get:

9800 = 0.55x

Dividing both sides by 0.55, we get:

x = 17,818

Therefore, the business must sell 17,818 units of the product before the revenue received equals the total expense of production, including the initial investment in equipment.

Final answer: D)17,818.

To solve this question, we need to first understand the given information. The tailor cuts each roll of fabric into 12 pieces. He cuts at the rate of 40 cuts per minute. In 30 minutes, he would have made 40 cuts/minute x 30 minutes = 1200 cuts. Since he cuts each roll of fabric into 12 pieces, we can divide the total number of cuts by 12 to find out how many rolls would be cut in 30 minutes.

Therefore, the final answer is 1200 cuts / 12 pieces per roll = 100 rolls.

Final answer: 100 rolls.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of permutations. We have 6 people (3 men and 3 women) and we need to arrange them in 2 rows with 3 chairs in each row.

First, let's consider the arrangement of the women. Since there are 3 women, there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to arrange them, which is 3! = 6 ways.

Next, we need to consider the arrangement of the men. Since all men have to be seated in the back row, there are only 3! ways to arrange them, which is 3! = 6 ways.

Now, we need to multiply the number of ways to arrange the women by the number of ways to arrange the men to get the total number of arrangements.

So, the total number of arrangements is 6 (ways to arrange women) x 6 (ways to arrange men) = 36 ways.

Therefore, the correct option is D) 36.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

We are given two pieces of information:

1. The train arrives at its destination 10 minutes late when its speed is 50 km/h.
2. The train arrives at its destination 50 minutes late when its speed is 30 km/h.

Let's denote the distance between the stations A and B as "d" kilometers.

When the train is traveling at 50 km/h, it takes 10 minutes to cover the distance "d". Therefore, the time taken by the train to cover the distance "d" at 50 km/h is:

Time = 10 minutes = d / 50 km/h

Similarly, when the train is traveling at 30 km/h, it takes 50 minutes to cover the distance "d". Therefore, the time taken by the train to cover the distance "d" at 30 km/h is:

Time = 50 minutes = d / 30 km/h

Now, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

For the first piece of information, we have:

d = 50 km/h x (10 minutes) = 500 km

For the second piece of information, we have:

d = 30 km/h x (50 minutes) = 1500 km

Since both distances are equal, we can take the average of the two distances to find the distance between the stations A and B:

Distance = (500 km + 1500 km) / 2 = 1000 km

Therefore, the distance between the stations A and B is 1000 kilometers.

Final answer: The distance between the stations A and B is 1000 kilometers.

Final answer:

The average age of the first seven people to arrive at Nikhil’s birthday is 21. When Vijay (29) arrived, the mean age is increased to 22. Marry (also 29) arrived next. The tenth and last person to arrive at Nikhil’s party is Nikhil himself, and the mean age increased to 30 years.

Let's denote the ages of the first seven people as A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, and A7.

The sum of their ages is:

A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7 = 21

The sum of the ages of the first eight people is:

A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7 + Vijay = 22

The sum of the ages of the first nine people is:

A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7 + Vijay + Marry = 22

The sum of the ages of the first ten people is:

A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7 + Vijay + Marry + Nikhil = 30

The sum of the ages of the first seven people and Nikhil is:

A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7 + Nikhil = 30

The sum of the ages of the first seven people is:

A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7 = 21

The sum of the ages of the first ten people is:

A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7 + Vijay + Marry + Nikhil = 30

Subtracting the sum of the ages of the first seven people from the sum of the ages of the first ten people gives us:

(A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7 + Vijay + Marry + Nikhil) - (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7) = 30 - 21 = 9

Since the sum of the ages of the first seven people is 21, we can write:

A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7 = 21

Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

(A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7 + Vijay + Marry + Nikhil) - (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7) = 9

Simplifying this equation, we get:

Vijay + Marry + Nikhil = 9

Since Vijay and Marry are both 29, we can write:

Vijay + Marry + Nikhil = 29 + 29 + 30 = 88

Therefore, Nikhil is 88 years old on his birthday.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many minutes it takes for Marla to complete 5 more laps around the track than Nick.

First, let's find out how many laps Nick completes in one minute:

1 minute / 12 laps per hour = 1/12 laps per minute

Next, let's find out how many laps Marla completes in one minute:

1 minute / 32 laps per hour = 1/32 laps per minute

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of laps Marla completes and the number of laps Nick completes in one minute:

32 laps per minute - 12 laps per minute = 20 laps per minute

Finally, we need to find how many minutes it takes for Marla to complete 5 more laps than Nick:

5 laps / 20 laps per minute = 0.25 minutes

Therefore, Marla will have completed 5 more laps around the track than Nick 0.25 minutes after they begin moving.

To solve this question, we need to use the concept of proportion. Let's denote the age of Yuvaraj as x and the age of Ganguly as y.

From the problem, we know that the proportion of Yuvaraj's age to Ganguly's age is 4:3. Therefore, we can write:

x/y = 4/3

We also know that after 6 years, Yuvaraj will be 26 years old. So, we can write another equation:

x + 6 = 26

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get:

x = 12
y = 12 \* (3/4) = 9

Therefore, the age of Ganguly now is 9 years.

Final answer: Ganguly is currently 9 years old.

To solve this question, we need to use the concept of percentage change. Let's denote the actual price of the cloth material as x.

If the man bought the cloth material 10% cheaper than the actual price, then he bought it for (0.9x).

If he sold the cloth material for 20% profit, then he sold it for (1.2x).

According to the question, if he had sold the cloth material for 25paise less, then he would have sold it for (1.2x - 25paise).

Since the man gained 10% as profit, we can write:

(1.2x - 25paise) = (0.9x) + 10%

Solving for x, we get:

0.3x = 25paise

x = 83.33

Therefore, the man sold the cloth material for 83.33.

To solve this question, we need to find the ratio of Tanya's age to her grandfather's age 8 years ago. Let's denote Tanya's age as T and her grandfather's age as G.

From the given information, we know that:

G = T + 8 (8 years from now)
G = T + 8 (8 years ago)

We also know that:

G = 8T (8 years ago)
G = 3T (8 years from now)

Now, we can set up a system of equations to solve for T and G:

T + 8 = T + 8
T + 8 = 3T

Solving for T, we get:

T = 8

Substituting T = 8 into the equation G = 8T, we get:

G = 8 x 8 = 64

Therefore, the ratio of Tanya's age to her grandfather's age 8 years ago is:

T:G = 8:64

Final answer:

To find the least possible value of |89 - 9a|, we need to minimize the absolute value of the expression. We can do this by finding the value of a that minimizes the expression.

We can start by finding the maximum possible value of 9a. Since a is an integer, the maximum possible value of 9a is 9 times the largest possible integer value, which is 9 times 2147483647 (the largest possible integer value), which is 1832739039.

Now, we can find the value of a that minimizes the expression by setting 9a equal to the maximum possible value of 9a, which is 1832739039. Solving for a, we get:

9a = 1832739039
a = 1832739039/9
a = 203637671

Therefore, the least possible value of |89 - 9a| is:

|89 - 9(203637671)| = |89 - 1832739039| = 1832738140

To solve this question, we need to use the concept of ratios. Let's assume that the quantity of milk in the mixture is x liters and the quantity of water in the mixture is y liters.

From the given information, we know that:

x/y = 26%

After replacing the mixture with 7 liters of pure milk, the quantity of milk in the mixture becomes:

(x+7)/y = 76%

We can now set up a system of equations:

x/y = 26%
(x+7)/y = 76%

Solving this system of equations, we get:

x = 26y
(26y+7)/y = 76
26y+7 = 76y
4y = 7
y = 1.75

Substituting y = 1.75 in x = 26y, we get:

x = 26 \* 1.75 = 45

Therefore, the quantity of the mixture is:

x + y = 45 + 1.75 = 46.75 liters

Now, we need to find the value of B's salary. We know that A's salary is 5175, and the new ratio of A's and B's salary is 9 : 4.5. To find the value of B's salary, we can set up a proportion:

A's salary / B's salary = 9 / 4.5

5175 / B's salary = 9 / 4.5

B's salary = 5175 * 4.5 / 9

B's salary = 2,250

Therefore, the salary of B is 2,250.

To solve this problem, we need to use algebra. Let's call the smaller number "x" and the larger number "y". According to the problem, we have two equations:

4x < 3y - 5
x + y > 6(y - x) + 6

We can simplify the second equation by distributing the 6 on the right side:

x + y > 6y - 6x + 6

Now we can combine the two equations by multiplying the first equation by 3 and subtracting it from the second equation:

3(4x < 3y - 5) - (x + y > 6y - 6x + 6)
12x < 9y - 15
x + y > 6y - 6x + 6

Now we can solve for y in terms of x:

12x + 6x > 6y - 6x + 6
18x > 6y + 6
y < -6x/3 + 2
y < -2x/3 + 2/3

Since x and y must be positive numbers, we know that y must be less than -2x/3 + 2/3. We can also see that y must be less than -2/3, since if y were greater than -2/3, then x would have to be negative, which would violate the conditions of the problem.

Therefore, the only possible solution is x = 39 and y = 43.

Let's denote the initial value of the money in fund A as x and the initial value of the money in fund B as y.
After one year, the value of the money in fund A was $10 higher than the value of the money in fund B, so x + 0.1x = y + 0.1y + 10.
Simplifying this equation, we get x = 1.1y + 10.
After another year, the value of the money in fund A was $25 higher than the value of the money in fund B, so x + 0.1x = y + 0.1y + 25.
Simplifying this equation, we get x = 1.1y + 25.
Substituting x = 1.1y + 10 in the first equation, we get 1.1y + 10 + 0.1(1.1y + 10) = y + 0.1y + 10 + 0.1(1.1y + 10).

To find the amount of green vegetables that can be obtained from 100 kg of vegetables, we need to first determine the amount of water in 100 kg of vegetables and then convert that amount to the equivalent amount of green vegetables.

First, let's calculate the amount of water in 100 kg of vegetables:

Water in vegetables = 100 kg * 68% = 68 kg

Next, we need to convert this amount of water to the equivalent amount of green vegetables. Since green vegetables contain 20% water, we can divide the amount of water in vegetables by the percentage of water in green vegetables to get the amount of green vegetables:

Green vegetables = Water in vegetables / Percentage of water in green vegetables
= 68 kg / 20%
= 3.4 kg

Therefore, 3.4 kg of green vegetables can be obtained from 100 kg of vegetables.

To solve this question, we need to first understand the set M. The set M contains even numbers from 1 to 23 and odd numbers from 24 to 100. We need to find the sum of all values in the set M.

Let's start by finding the sum of even numbers from 1 to 23. The sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula:

Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)

where n is the number of terms in the series. In this case, n = 23, the first term is 1 and the last term is 23. So, the sum of even numbers from 1 to 23 is:

Sum = (23/2) * (1 + 23) = 115

Next, let's find the sum of odd numbers from 24 to 100. The sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula:

Sum = (n/2) * (first term + last term)

where n is the number of terms in the series. In this case, n = 77, the first term is 24 and the last term is 100. So, the sum of odd numbers from 24 to 100 is:

Sum = (77/2) * (24 + 100) = 2315

Now, we need to find the sum of all values in the set M. The set M contains even numbers from 1 to 23 and odd numbers from 24 to 100. So, the sum of all values in the set M is:

Sum = Sum of even numbers + Sum of odd numbers
Sum = 115 + 2315
Sum = 2430

Finally, we need to find the number of zeroes in the sum of all values in the set M. We can do this by dividing the sum by 10 and counting the number of zeroes in the result. The sum of all values in the set M is 2430. Dividing 2430 by 10 gives us 243. There are 3 zeroes in 243.

Therefore, the number of zeroes in the sum of all values in the set M is 3.

Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to use the following steps:

1. Let's denote the number of innings played in England as x.
2. The total number of runs scored in England is 46x.
3. The total number of runs scored in India is 2x(55) = 110x.
4. The total number of runs scored in both England and India is 46x + 110x = 156x.
5. The average number of runs scored in both England and India is 156x / (2x + x) = 156x / 3x = 52.
6. The average number of runs scored in England is 46x / x = 46.
7. The difference between the two averages is 52 - 46 = 6.
8. Since the difference is 6, we can write the equation: 46x / x = 52.
9. Solving for x, we get x = 46/52 = 9/2.
10. Since x must be a whole number, we can round it to the nearest whole number, which is 9.

Therefore, the number of innings played in England is 9.

Final answer: The number of innings played in England is 9.

Final answer:

To find the principal amount, we can use the formula for simple interest:

I = P \* r \* t

Where:
I = Interest
P = Principal amount
r = Rate of interest (in decimal form)
t = Time (in years)

We are given the interest (I = Rs. 4016.25), rate of interest (r = 9% = 0.09), and time (t = 5 years). We need to solve for the principal amount (P).

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

4016.25 = P \* 0.09 \* 5

Simplifying, we get:

4016.25 = 0.45 \* P

Dividing both sides by 0.45, we get:

P = 4016.25 / 0.45

P = Rs. 8879.99

Therefore, the principal amount is Rs. 8879.99.

Final answer: Rs. 8879.99.

Final answer:

To find the combined percentage of defective parts, we first need to determine the number of defective parts in each shipment.

For the first shipment of 120 parts, 5% were defective:

Defective parts in the first shipment = Total parts * Defect rate
= 120 * 0.05
= 6

For the second shipment of 80 parts, 10% were defective:

Defective parts in the second shipment = Total parts * Defect rate
= 80 * 0.10
= 8

Now, we add the number of defective parts from both shipments:

Total defective parts = Defective parts in the first shipment + Defective parts in the second shipment
= 6 + 8
= 14

Next, we calculate the total number of parts in both shipments:

Total parts = Parts in the first shipment + Parts in the second shipment
= 120 + 80
= 200

Finally, we calculate the combined percentage of defective parts:

Percentage of defective parts = (Total defective parts / Total parts) * 100
= (14 / 200) * 100
= 7.0%

Therefore, the final answer is B)7.0%.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use the given information to find the average length of the sticks in Box W and Box V, and then subtract the average length of the sticks in Box V from the average length of the sticks in Box W.

Let's assume that there are n sticks in Box W and m sticks in Box V.

The average length of the sticks in Box W is given by:

(19 + (19 - average length of sticks in Box W))/2

Similarly, the average length of the sticks in Box V is given by:

(6 + (average length of sticks in Box V + 6))/2

We know that the average length of the sticks in Box W is 19 inches less than the average length of the sticks in Box V, so we can write:

(19 + (19 - average length of sticks in Box W))/2 = (average length of sticks in Box V + 6)/2 + 6

Solving for the average length of the sticks in Box W, we get:

average length of sticks in Box W = (average length of sticks in Box V + 6)/2 - 6

Now, we can find the average length of the sticks in Box V using the given information:

(6 + (average length of sticks in Box V + 6))/2 = average length of sticks in Box V

Solving for the average length of the sticks in Box V, we get:

average length of sticks in Box V = 6

Substituting this value into the equation for the average length of the sticks in Box W, we get:

average length of sticks in Box W = (6 + 6)/2 - 6 = 3

Finally, we can find the average (arithmetic mean) length, in inches, of the sticks in Box W minus the average length, in inches, of the sticks in Box V:

average length of sticks in Box W - average length of sticks in Box V = 3 - 6 = -3

Therefore, the average (arithmetic mean) length, in inches, of the sticks in Box W minus the average length, in inches, of the sticks in Box V is -3.

Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to use the following steps:

1. First, we need to find the profit made by the shopkeeper. We know that the selling price of the t-shirt is 4200 and that the shopkeeper made 33.33% profit. So, the profit can be calculated as:
Profit = Selling price x Profit percentage
Profit = 4200 x 33.33%
Profit = 4200 x 0.3333
Profit = 1400

2. Next, we need to find the cost price of the t-shirt. We know that the selling price is 4200 and the profit is 1400. So, the cost price can be calculated as:
Cost price = Selling price - Profit
Cost price = 4200 - 1400
Cost price = 2800

Therefore, the cost price of the t-shirt is 2800.

Final answer: The cost price of the t-shirt is 2800.

Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to use algebra to represent the given information. Let's denote Promila's current age as P and Jenilia's current age as J.

We know that 1 year ago, Promila was 4 times as old as her daughter Jenilia. So, we can write:
P = 4J

In 6 years, Promila's age will exceed her daughter's age by 9 years. So, we can write:
P + 6 = J + 9

The ratio of the present ages of Promila and her daughter is :
P/J = 13/4

Now, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation:
4J + 6 = J + 9

Subtracting J from both sides, we get:
3J + 6 = 9

Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get:
3J = 3

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
J = 1

Now that we know Jenilia's age, we can find Promila's age using the first equation:
P = 4J = 4(1) = 4

Therefore, the ratio of the present ages of Promila and her daughter is:
P/J = 4/1 = 13/4

The correct option is A)13:4.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each shirt separately and then apply the discounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first shirt:
Cost of first shirt = $20

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second shirt after applying the 15% discount on the first shirt:
Cost of second shirt = (1 - 0.15) x $20 = $17

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the second shirt after applying the 10% discount on the reduced price:
Cost of second shirt = (1 - 0.10) x $17 = $15.3

Therefore, the total cost for two shirts would be:
Total cost = Cost of first shirt + Cost of second shirt = $20 + $15.3 = $35.3

Final answer: E) $32.7 is incorrect. The correct answer is D) $32.6.

Final answer:

Let's denote the actual price per piece as P and the quantity sold as Q. We know that the total sales value is Rs. 1,148, so we can write:

PQ = 1148

We also know that the inventory reduced by 54, so we can write:

PQ = 1148 - 54

Now, we can solve for P:

PQ = 1148 - 54
PQ = 1094

Since both Q and P are two-digit numbers, we can assume that Q = 10a and P = 10b, where a and b are digits. Then, we can write:

10a * 10b = 1094

Expanding this equation, we get:

100ab = 1094

Since the sum of the digits of 1094 is 1 + 0 + 9 + 4 = 14, we know that the sum of the digits of Q and P must also be 14. Therefore, we can write:

a + b = 14

We also know that Q = 10a, so we can write:

a + b = 14
a = 14 - b

Substituting this expression for a into the equation for Q, we get:

10(14 - b) * 10b = 1094

Expanding this equation, we get:

140b - 10b^2 = 1094

Rearranging this equation to form a quadratic equation, we get:

10b^2 - 140b + 1094 = 0

Dividing both sides of this equation by 10, we get:

b^2 - 14b + 109.4 = 0

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

b = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

where a = 1, b = -14, and c = 109.4.

Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

b = (-(-14) ± sqrt((-14)^2 - 4(1)(109.4))) / 2(1)

b = (14 ± sqrt(196 - 437.6)) / 2

b = (14 ± sqrt(-241.6)) / 2

Since the square root of a negative number is not a real number, we know that there is no real solution to this equation. Therefore, there is no real value of P that satisfies the given conditions.

Final answer: There is no real value of P that satisfies the given conditions.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use algebra. Let's denote the breadth of the wall as x. Then, the height of the wall is 5x and the length of the wall is 8 times the height, which is 8(5x) = 40x. The volume of the wall is given as 12.8 cubic meters. We can set up an equation to represent this information:

x \* 5x \* 40x = 12.8

Simplifying this equation, we get:

200x^3 = 12.8

Dividing both sides by 200, we get:

x^3 = 0.064

Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:

x = 0.4

Therefore, the breadth of the wall is 0.4 meters.

Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to use the formula for simple interest and the formula for compound interest.

Let the principal be P.

Simple interest = P * r * t
Compound interest = P * (1 + r)^t

We know that Anil invested for 2 years at the rate of 15% per annum at simple interest. Let's denote the simple interest as S.

S = P * 0.15 * 2 = 0.3P

We also know that if Anil had invested in a scheme in which interest was compounded yearly, he would have got Rs.450 more. Let's denote the compound interest as C.

C = P * (1 + 0.15)^2 = 1.325P

We know that S = 0.3P and C = 1.325P. Therefore,

0.3P = 1.325P - 450

Solving for P, we get

P = 450

Therefore, the principal is Rs.450.

Final answer: Rs.450.

To solve this question, we need to first calculate the cost of fuel for one car, then multiply that by the number of cars, and finally add the cost of service.

The cost of fuel for one car is 80 liters * $1/liter = $80.

The total cost of fuel for all 50 cars is 50 * $80 = $4000.

The cost of service for all 50 cars is 50 * $2 = $100.

Therefore, the total cost to fuel all cars is $4000 + $100 = $4100.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to find out when A and B will meet. We can do this by calculating how far each of them travels in an hour and then finding the time it takes for them to cover the same distance.

Let's first calculate how far A travels in an hour:

A travels 40 kmph, so in an hour, he covers 40 km.

Now, let's calculate how far B travels in an hour:

B travels 50 kmph, so in an hour, he covers 50 km.

Since they are traveling in the same direction, we need to find the time it takes for them to cover the same distance. Let's call this time "t".

So, we have:

40t = 50t

To solve for t, we can divide both sides by 10:

4t = 5t

Now, we can solve for t:

t = 1 hour

So, they will meet after 1 hour.

Final answer:

Varsha bought a Laptop for $1060, which was the retail price plus a 6 percent sales tax. How much money could she have saved if she had bought the stereo at the same retail price in a neighboring state where she would have paid a sales tax of 5 percent?

To solve this question, we need to first calculate the sales tax on the laptop and then compare it with the sales tax on the stereo.

The sales tax on the laptop is 6% of $1060, which is $63.60.

If Varsha had bought the stereo in a neighboring state where she would have paid a sales tax of 5% of $1060, which is $53.00.

Therefore, Varsha could have saved $10.60 by buying the stereo in the neighboring state.

Final answer:

The cyclist travels for 25 minutes late, so he covers an additional distance of 25 minutes \* 10 kmph = 2.5 km.
The train is 5 km ahead of the cyclist, so the cyclist has covered 5 km - 2.5 km = 2.5 km before meeting the train.
The cyclist travels at a speed of 10 kmph, so he covers 2.5 km in 2.5 hours = 2.5 km/h.
The train is 5 km ahead of the cyclist, so it covers 5 km in 2.5 hours = 2 km/h.
Therefore, the speed of the train is 2 km/h / 2.5 km = 0.8 km/h.

Final answer:

The man in the slower train passes the faster train in 18 seconds. Let's denote the distance between the two trains as D. The distance covered by the faster train in 18 seconds is D. The distance covered by the slower train in 18 seconds is D/3. Since the man in the slower train passes the faster train, the distance covered by the slower train is equal to the distance covered by the faster train. Therefore, D/3 = D. Solving for D, we get D = 360.

The length of the faster train is given by the distance covered by the faster train in 18 seconds, which is D = 360. Therefore, the length of the faster train is 360.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We can find the total number of members in the swim club by adding the number of members who have passed the lifesaving test and the number of members who have not passed the test, and then subtracting the number of members who have taken the preparatory course.

Let's denote the total number of members in the swim club as x.

Number of members who have passed the lifesaving test = 0.3x
Number of members who have not passed the lifesaving test = 0.7x
Number of members who have taken the preparatory course = 12
Number of members who have not taken the preparatory course = 30

According to the problem, we can write:

0.3x + 0.7x - 12 - 30 = x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.6x - 42 = x

Adding 42 to both sides, we get:

0.6x = 84

Dividing both sides by 0.6, we get:

x = 140

Therefore, there are 140 members in the swim club.

To find the price at which the plot should be sold for a gain of 15%, we need to first calculate the selling price of the plot when it is sold for a loss of 15%.

The selling price of the plot when it is sold for a loss of 15% is:

18700 \* (1 - 0.15) = 15425

To find the selling price of the plot when it is sold for a gain of 15%, we need to add 15% to the selling price of the plot when it is sold for a loss of 15%.

15425 \* 1.15 = 17841.25

Therefore, the plot should be sold for Rs. 17841.25 to achieve a gain of 15%.

mistral7b Task 129:


Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to use the formula for compound interest:
A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
A = the future value of the loan
P = the principal amount (the sum borrowed)
r = the rate of interest (as a decimal)
n = the number of times the interest is compounded per year
t = the number of years the loan is outstanding

In this case, we know that the loan was repaid in two annual instalments of Rs.112 each, so the principal amount (P) is Rs.112. The rate of interest (r) is 10% per annum, which is 0.1 as a decimal. The loan is compounded annually (n=1), and it is outstanding for two years (t=2).

We can use the formula to calculate the future value of the loan after two years:
A = 112(1 + 0.1/1)^(1*2)
A = 112(1 + 0.1)^2
A = 112(1.1)^2
A = 133.29

Therefore, the sum borrowed was Rs.133.29.

Final answer: Rs.133.29.

Final answer:

Company Y has 24 part-time employees.

Explanation:

1. Let's denote the number of part-time employees of Company X as x.
2. According to the problem, Company Y has 4 more than twice the number of part-time employees that Company X has, so we can write this as: 2x + 4 = 4y, where y is the number of part-time employees of Company Y.
3. We also know that Company Y has 50 full-time employees, and Company X has 40 full-time employees. So, the total number of employees in both companies is 40 + 50 = 90.
4. Since Company X has 40 full-time employees, it means that Company X has 90 - 40 = 50 total employees.
5. Using the fact that Company Y has 50 total employees, we can write another equation: 50 = 40 + 2x + 4.
6. Solving for x, we get: x = 10.
7. Substituting x = 10 into the equation 2x + 4 = 4y, we get: 20 + 4 = 4y, which simplifies to y = 24.
8. Therefore, Company Y has 24 part-time employees.

To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of similarity between the two shapes. Since ASB is a quarter circle and PQRS is a rectangle, we can draw a line from P to Q, which will bisect the rectangle and create two right triangles. The hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by PQ and QR is equal to the length of the arc AQB.

Let's denote the length of the arc AQB as x. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle:

x^2 = (8/2)^2 + (6/2)^2
x^2 = 64 + 36
x^2 = 100
x = √100
x = 10

Therefore, the length of the arc AQB is 10 units.

To solve this question, we need to use the information provided to find the distance between Tribe S and Tribe P. We know that Tribe R is 60 miles away from Tribe P and Tribe S is 40 miles away from Tribe B. We also know that Tribe R is 10 miles nearer to Tribe S than it is to Tribe Q.

Let's start by using the information about Tribe R and Tribe P to find the distance between Tribe S and Tribe Q. Since Tribe R is 10 miles nearer to Tribe S than it is to Tribe Q, we can write:

Tribe R - Tribe Q = 10 miles
Tribe R - Tribe P = 60 miles

Solving for Tribe Q, we get:

Tribe Q = Tribe R - 10 miles
Tribe Q = 60 miles - 10 miles
Tribe Q = 50 miles

Now we know that Tribe S is 40 miles away from Tribe B and Tribe R is 60 miles away from Tribe P. We can use this information to find the distance between Tribe S and Tribe P. Since Tribe R is between Tribe S and Tribe P, we can write:

Tribe R - Tribe S = 40 miles
Tribe R - Tribe P = 60 miles

Solving for Tribe S, we get:

Tribe S = Tribe R - 40 miles
Tribe S = 60 miles - 40 miles
Tribe S = 20 miles

Therefore, the Tribe S is located 20 miles away from Tribe P.

To solve this question, we need to use the given ratio of bleach to water and the total volume of the solution. Let's denote the amount of bleach as x and the amount of water as y.

From the problem, we know that:

x/y = 1/4
x + y = 36

We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:

x = (1/4)y

Substituting this expression for x into the second equation, we get:

(1/4)y + y = 36

Multiplying both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

y + 4y = 144

Combining like terms, we get:

5y = 144

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:

y = 28.8

Now, we can find the amount of bleach using the expression for x:

x = (1/4)(28.8) = 7.2

Therefore, John put 7.2 ml of bleach into the solution.

Final answer: John put 7.2 ml of bleach into the solution.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that 300 vehicles were neither SUVs nor powered by diesel.
2. 3/4th of the SUVs registered were diesel powered.
3. There were half as many SUVs as there were non-SUVs.
4. SUVs not powered by diesel were a sixth of non-SUVs not powered by diesel.

Let's denote the number of non-SUVs as N and the number of SUVs as S.

From the information given, we can write the following equations:

S = N/2
SUVs powered by diesel = 3/4 * S
SUVs not powered by diesel = S/6

We also know that the total number of vehicles registered is 300 + N.

Now, we can use these equations to solve for the number of vehicles powered by diesel:

SUVs powered by diesel + SUVs not powered by diesel = Total vehicles registered
(3/4 * S) + (S/6) = 300 + N

Multiplying both sides by 12 to eliminate fractions:

3S + S = 3600 + 12N
4S = 3600 + 12N

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use algebra. Let's denote the number of small lures sold as x, the number of medium lures sold as y, and the number of large lures sold as z. We know that the total weight of the lures sold is 216,000 grams, so we can write the equation:

3x + 4y + 5z = 216,000

We also know that the number of small lures sold is less than the number of medium lures sold, so we can write another equation:

x < y

We can simplify the first equation by dividing both sides by 2:

x + 2y + z = 108,000

Now we can use the second equation to solve for x:

x = y - z

Substituting this expression for x into the simplified equation, we get:

y - z + 2y + z = 108,000
3y = 108,000
y = 36,000

So Bill sold 36,000 medium lures.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is V = πr^2h, where V is the volume, r is the radius, and h is the height. We know that the volume of soda in the can is 72π cubic inches, and the diameter of the can is 8 inches. Therefore, the radius of the can is half of the diameter, which is 4 inches.

We can set up an equation using the formula for the volume of a cylinder and the given information:

72π = π(4)^2h

Simplifying the equation, we get:

72 = 16h

Dividing both sides by 16, we get:

h = 4.5

Therefore, the height of the can is 4.5 inches.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of proportions. Let x be the amount of Maxim that needs to be added to the three quarts of Minum.

The amount of hydrogen peroxide in the resulting mixture will be the sum of the hydrogen peroxide in the three quarts of Minum and the amount of hydrogen peroxide in x quarts of Maxim.

Let h be the amount of hydrogen peroxide in the three quarts of Minum. Then, the amount of hydrogen peroxide in x quarts of Maxim is 0.2x.

The total amount of hydrogen peroxide in the resulting mixture is h + 0.2x.

We know that the total amount of hydrogen peroxide in the resulting mixture is 10% of the total volume of the mixture. Let V be the total volume of the mixture. Then, the amount of hydrogen peroxide in the resulting mixture is 0.1V.

We can set up the following proportion:

h + 0.2x / V = 0.1V

Solving for h, we get:

h = 0.1V - 0.2x

Substituting this value of h in the above proportion, we get:

(0.1V - 0.2x) / V = 0.1V

Solving for x, we get:

x = 0.2V

Therefore, 0.2V quarts of Maxim should be added to the three quarts of Minum so that the resulting mixture contains 10% hydrogen peroxide.

Final answer: E. The correct option is E.

Final answer:

The weight of the empty tin is 0.4 pounds.

Explanation:

1. Let's denote the weight of the tin as x and the weight of the cookies as y.
2. We know that the total weight of the tin and the cookies is 2 pounds, so x + y = 2.
3. After 3/4 of the cookies are eaten, the tin and the remaining cookies weigh 0.8 pounds, so x + (3/4)y = 0.8.
4. We can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y.
5. Multiplying the first equation by 4, we get 4x + 4y = 8.
6. Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get x = 4y - 0.8.
7. Substituting this expression for x into the second equation, we get 4y - 0.8 + (3/4)y = 0.8.
8. Simplifying this equation, we get (7/4)y = 0.
9. Solving for y, we get y = 0.
10. Substituting this value of y into the expression for x, we get x = 4(0) - 0.8 = -0.8.
11. Since the weight cannot be negative, we know that there must be an error in the problem statement.
12. However, if we assume that the weight of the tin is positive, then the weight of the cookies must be negative.
13. This is not possible, as the weight cannot be negative.
14. Therefore, the weight of the tin must be negative, and the weight of the cookies must be positive.
15. Since the total weight of the tin and the cookies is 2 pounds, the weight of the tin must be 2 - y, and the weight of the cookies must be y.
16. Substituting these values into the second equation, we get 2 - y + (3/4)y = 0.8.
17. Simplifying this equation, we get (1/4)y = 0.

mistral7b Task 148:


Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of combinations. We have 6 couples, and we want to choose a group of 3 people without any couple being chosen. This means that we can only choose individuals from the same couple.

Let's first calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 people from 6 couples without any restrictions. This can be calculated using the formula for combinations:

C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)

where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes factorial.

In this case, n = 6 and k = 3. So,

C(6, 3) = 6! / (3!(6-3)!)
= 720 / (6*6)
= 20

Now, let's calculate the number of ways to choose 3 people from 6 couples where at least one couple is chosen. This can be calculated by adding the number of ways to choose 3 people from 4 couples (where at least one couple is chosen) and the number of ways to choose 3 people from 2 couples (where at least one couple is chosen).

The number of ways to choose 3 people from 4 couples (where at least one couple is chosen) can be calculated using the formula:

C(4, 3) = 4! / (3!(4-3)!)
= 24

The number of ways to choose 3 people from 2 couples (where at least one couple is chosen) can be calculated using the formula:

C(2, 3) = 2! / (3!(2-3)!)
= 2

So, the total number of ways to choose 3 people from 6 couples where at least one couple is chosen is:

24 + 2
= 26

Now, we can subtract the number of ways to choose 3 people from 6 couples where at least one couple is chosen from the total number of ways to choose 3 people from 6 couples to get the number of ways to choose 3 people from 6 couples where no couple is chosen:

20 - 26
= -6

However, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as it implies that there are negative ways to choose 3 people from 6 couples where no couple is chosen. This is because we made an error in our calculation.

We made an error in our calculation by assuming that we can only choose individuals from the same couple. However, we can also choose individuals from different couples as long as no couple is chosen. So, we need to add the number of ways to choose 3 people from 2 couples (where no couple is chosen) to our previous calculation.

The number of ways to choose 3 people from 2 couples (where no couple is chosen) can be calculated using the formula:

C(2, 3) = 2! / (3!(2-3)!)
= 2

So, the total number of ways to choose 3 people from 6 couples where no couple is chosen is:

26 + 2
= 28

Therefore, the final answer is:

Final answer: E)180

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use the counting principle. The counting principle states that if there are m ways to do one thing and n ways to do another, then there are m*n ways to do both.

For the first three questions, there are 4 choices each, so there are 4^3 = 64 possible sequences of answers for these questions.

For the next three questions, there are 5 choices each, so there are 5^3 = 125 possible sequences of answers for these questions.

To find the total number of possible sequences of answers, we multiply the number of possible sequences for the first three questions by the number of possible sequences for the next three questions:

Total sequences = 64 * 125 = 8000

Therefore, there are 8000 possible sequences of answers for the examination.

Final answer:

The train's slower speed is 25 kmph.

Explanation:

1. Let the train's original speed be x kmph.
2. The distance covered in 8 hours at x kmph is 8x.
3. If the train traveled 5 km an hour faster, its new speed would be (x+5) kmph.
4. The distance covered in 6 hours and 40 minutes (0.666666667 hours) at (x+5) kmph is 6(x+5).
5. Since the distance covered in both cases is the same, we can set up the equation: 8x = 6(x+5).
6. Solving for x, we get x = 25 kmph.
7. Therefore, the train's slower speed is 25 kmph.

Final answer: The train's slower speed is 25 kmph.

Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to use the formula for the circumference of a cylinder, which is 2πr, where r is the radius of the base.

First, we need to find the circumference of the cylinder with a radius of 14 cm:

Circumference of cylinder with radius 14 cm = 2π(14) = 49 cm

Next, we need to find out how many times the rope can make 70 rounds of the circumference of the cylinder with a radius of 14 cm:

Number of rounds = Circumference of cylinder with radius 14 cm / Circumference of cylinder with radius 20 cm

Number of rounds = 49 cm / (2π(20)) = 49 / 40 = 1.225

Since the rope can only make whole numbers of rounds, we round up to the nearest whole number:

Number of rounds = 2

Therefore, the rope can go around a cylinder having a radius of 20 cm 2 times.

Final answer: B. The correct option is B.

Final answer:

The steamer going upstream would cover the distance between Town A and Town B in 5 hours. The same steamer going downstream would cover the distance between the towns in 3 hours. How long would it take a raft moving at the speed of the current to float from B to A?

To solve this question, we need to find the distance between Town A and Town B. We can do this by using the information given about the steamer going upstream.

The steamer going upstream would cover the distance between Town A and Town B in 5 hours. Therefore, the distance between Town A and Town B is 5 hours * speed of steamer = 5 * 4 = 20 km.

Now, we need to find out how long it would take for a raft moving at the speed of the current to float from B to A. We know that the distance between Town A and Town B is 20 km.

Let's assume that the speed of the current is x km/h. Then, the time it would take for the raft to float from B to A is 20 km / x km/h = 20/x hours.

Therefore, the final answer is 20/x hours.

Final answer: 20/x hours.

To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total amount of money available for payment to the musicians. We know that the bride and groom paid $1000 for the gig, and the manager has a $100 booking fee. So, the total amount available for payment is:

$1000 - $100 = $900

Next, we need to divide this amount equally among the 9 musicians. To do this, we simply divide the total amount by the number of musicians:

$900 / 9 = $100

Therefore, the manager will have to give each musician $100 in order to pay them equally.

Final answer: E) $100

Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to use the Chain-of-Thought methodology. We need to identify the key elements of the question and the facts provided to ensure that the final answer is consistent with the provided context. We also need to ensure that the final answer is consistent with the step-by-step reasoning by cross-referencing each step with the provided context.

Let's start by identifying the key elements of the question:

* The test consists of two sections.
* The first section contains 40 questions.
* The second section contains 80 questions.
* The student answered 70 percent of all the questions in the test correctly.
* The student answered 60 percent of the questions in the second section correctly.

We need to find out what percent of the questions the student answered in the first section correctly. To do this, we need to use the information provided about the total number of questions and the number of questions answered correctly in the first and second sections.

Let's assume that the total number of questions in the test is T. Then, the number of questions in the first section is 40 and the number of questions in the second section is 80.

We know that the student answered 70 percent of all the questions in the test correctly. So, the number of questions answered correctly in the test is 0.7T.

We also know that the student answered 60 percent of the questions in the second section correctly. So, the number of questions answered correctly in the second section is 0.6(80) = 48.

Since the total number of questions in the test is T, the number of questions answered correctly in the first section is T - 40 - 48 = 0.

Therefore, the percent of the questions the student answered in the first section correctly is 0/40 = 0%.

Final answer: 0%.

Final answer:

The population of a city increases at the rate of 4% per annum. There is an additional annual increase of 1% in the population due to the influx of job seekers. Therefore, the % increase in the population after 2 years will be:

Let's denote the initial population as P. After the first year, the population will be P(1+0.04) = 1.04P. After the second year, the population will be (1.04P)(1+0.01) = 1.0504P.

To find the percentage increase in the population after 2 years, we can use the formula:

Percentage increase = ((Final population - Initial population) / Initial population) x 100

Substituting the values, we get:

Percentage increase = ((1.0504P - P) / P) x 100
Percentage increase = (0.0504P / P) x 100
Percentage increase = 5.04%

Therefore, the % increase in the population after 2 years will be 5.04%.

To solve this question, we need to use the concept of permutations. The number of ways to arrange n objects is given by the factorial of n, denoted by n!. In this case, we have 5 books, so the number of arrangements is 5! = 120.

If we move one book every minute, then the total time taken to arrange the books will be equal to the number of arrangements multiplied by the time taken to move one book. Since we are moving one book every minute, the time taken to move one book is 1 minute.

Therefore, the total time taken to arrange the books will be 120 minutes.

Final answer:

To find out how many hours the squad needs to practice on Friday, we first need to calculate the total number of hours they have practiced from Monday through Thursday.

From Monday through Thursday, they practice for 1 hour a day, so the total number of hours practiced is:

1 hour/day * 4 days = 4 hours

To find out how many hours they need to practice on Friday in order to have practiced an average of 2 hours a day over the 5 days from Monday through Friday, we need to divide the total number of hours they have practiced by 5:

4 hours / 5 days = 0.8 hours/day

Since they need to practice an average of 2 hours a day, we can subtract the total number of hours they have practiced from the desired total number of hours:

2 hours/day - 0.8 hours/day = 1.2 hours/day

So, they need to practice for 1.2 hours on Friday in order to have practiced an average of 2 hours a day over the 5 days from Monday through Friday.

Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to first understand the given information. We know that the business printer can print 100 characters per second, which is 5 times faster than an average printer. We also know that the average printer can print 4 times faster than an electric typewriter.

Let's denote the speed of the electric typewriter as x characters per second. Then, the speed of the average printer is 4x characters per second, and the speed of the business printer is 5 times that of the average printer, which is 20x characters per second.

We are given that the business printer can print 100 characters per second, so we can set up the following equation:

20x = 100

Solving for x, we get:

x = 50

So, the electric typewriter can print 50 characters per second.

To find out how many characters per minute the electric typewriter can print, we need to multiply the speed by the number of seconds in a minute, which is 60:

50 characters/second * 60 seconds/minute = 3000 characters/minute

Therefore, the electric typewriter can print 3000 characters per minute.

Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to use the chain-of-thought methodology. We start with the given information:

1. 50% of all high school students hate roller coasters; the rest love them.
2. 20% of those students who love roller coasters own chinchillas.

We can use the first piece of information to find out how many students love roller coasters:

1. 50% of all high school students love roller coasters.

Next, we can use the second piece of information to find out how many of these students own chinchillas:

1. 20% of those students who love roller coasters own chinchillas.
2. 20% of 50% = 10%.

Now, we want to find out what percentage of students love roller coasters but do not own a chinchilla. To do this, we subtract the percentage of students who own chinchillas from the total percentage of students who love roller coasters:

1. 50% - 10% = 40%.

Therefore, 40% of students love roller coasters but do not own a chinchilla.

Final answer: 40%.

Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to find out how many lines are needed to print 100 lines with 80 characters.

Let's assume that the letter is printed with 40 characters per line.

We can use the following formula to find out how many lines are needed:

Number of lines = Total characters / Characters per line

Substituting the given values:

Number of lines = 100 / 40

Number of lines = 2.5

Since we cannot have half a line, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, the number of lines needed is 3.

Final answer: C)400

Final answer: E. Cannot be determined.

Explanation:

1. Let the common difference between the terms of the arithmetic progression be d.
2. Then, the sum of the 3rd and 15th elements of the series is (3+14)d = 17d.
3. Similarly, the sum of the 6th, 11th, and 13th elements of the series is (6+11+12)d = 39d.
4. According to the problem, 17d = 39d.
5. Solving for d, we get d = 0.
6. This means that the terms of the arithmetic progression are all zero.
7. Therefore, the 1st element of the series should necessarily be equal to zero.

Final answer: A. The 1st element of the series should necessarily be equal to zero.

Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to find out how much time the printer was actually working and then multiply that by the printing speed.

First, let's find out how much time the printer was actually working. We know that it started at 8.15 a.m and ended at 9.20 p.m, which is a total of 1.05 hours (9.20 - 8.15 = 1.05).

However, the printer was interrupted twice for a total of 42 minutes. So, we need to subtract this time from the total working time.

Total working time = 1.05 - 42/60 = 0.95 hours

Now, we need to multiply this by the printing speed of 100 instructions per hour to find out how many instructions the printer printed.

Number of instructions = 0.95 x 100 = 95

Therefore, the printer printed 95 instructions.

Final answer: 95.

Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to use the Chain-of-Thought methodology. We need to identify the key elements of the question and the facts provided to ensure that the final answer is consistent with the provided context. We also need to ensure that the final answer is consistent with the step-by-step reasoning by cross-referencing each step with the provided context.

We know that the fisherman catches 53 fishes in a week that includes good, fair and poor days. We also know that the fisherman's day is rated as good if he catches 9 fishes, fair if he catches 7 fishes and poor if he catches 5 fishes.

Let's assume that the fisherman had x good days, y fair days and z poor days during the week.

From the information given, we can write the following equations:

x + y + z = 7 (since there are 7 days in a week)
9x + 7y + 5z = 53 (since the fisherman catches 53 fishes in a week)

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x, y and z.

x = (53 - 7 - 5z) / 9
y = 7 - x - z

Substituting the value of x in the equation for y, we get:

y = 7 - ((53 - 7 - 5z) / 9) - z
y = (49 - 5z) / 9

Substituting the value of y in the equation for x, we get:

x = (53 - 7 - 5z) / 9
x = (53 - 49 + 5z) / 9
x = (5z + 4) / 9

Substituting the value of x in the equation for y, we get:

y = (5z + 4) / 9
y = (5z + 4) / 9

   B
   |
   C
   |
   D
```
We know that the distance between doors B and D is 10 meters, and the distance between A and C is 12 meters. Since the corridor is straight, we can assume that the lines AB and CD are parallel.

Let's call the distance between doors B and C x meters. Then, the distance between doors A and C is (x+12) meters.

Since AB and CD are parallel, we can set up the following equation:
```scss
AB = CD
10 = x + (x+12)
```
Solving for x, we get:
```scss
2x + 12 = 10
2x = 2
x = 1
```
Therefore, the distance between doors B and C is 1 meter.

Final answer:

The man gains Rs. 30.

Explanation:

The man bought the watch for Rs. 1950 in cash and sold it for Rs. 2200 on credit of 1 year. The interest rate on the credit is 10% per annum.

First, we need to calculate the interest earned on the credit.

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

Principal = Rs. 2200
Rate = 10% = 0.10
Time = 1 year = 1

Interest = Rs. 2200 x 0.10 x 1 = Rs. 220

The man earned Rs. 220 as interest on the credit.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount the man received from selling the watch.

Total amount = Selling price + Interest

Selling price = Rs. 2200
Interest = Rs. 220

Total amount = Rs. 2200 + Rs. 220 = Rs. 2420

Finally, we need to calculate the gain the man made from selling the watch.

Gain = Total amount - Cost

Cost = Rs. 1950

Gain = Rs. 2420 - Rs. 1950 = Rs. 470

The man gained Rs. 470 from selling the watch.

Final answer:

Let's denote the amount of money Pankaj has as P, Sohan has as S, and Akhil has as A.

From the problem, we know that:

1. Akhil has twice as much money as Sohan, so A = 2S.
2. Sohan has 50% more money than what Pankaj has, so S = 1.5P.
3. The average money with them is Rs 110, so (A + S + P) / 3 = 110.

Substituting the expressions for A and S from steps 1 and 2 into the equation in step 3, we get:

(2S + S + P) / 3 = 110
4S + 3P = 330

We also know that A = 2S, so we can substitute this expression for A into the equation:

4S + 3P = 330
4(1.5P) + 3P = 330
6P + 3P = 330
9P = 330

Dividing both sides by 9, we get:

P = 36.67 (rounded to two decimal places)

Now, we can find the values of S and A using the expressions we found earlier:

S = 1.5P = 1.5 x 36.67 = 55
A = 2S = 2 x 55 = 110

Therefore, Akhil has Rs 110, Sohan has Rs 55, and Pankaj has Rs 36.67.

To solve this question, we need to use the following steps:

1. We know that 68% of the voters exercised their franchise. So, we need to find out the total number of voters.
2. We also know that 48% of the voters were women. So, we need to find out the number of women voters.
3. We are given that the number of males exercising their franchise was 53,040. So, we need to find out the number of males voters.
4. Since the total number of voters is the sum of male and female voters, we can write:
Total voters = Male voters + Female voters
5. Substituting the given values, we get:
Total voters = 53,040 + 0.48 * Total voters
6. Solving for Total voters, we get:
Total voters = 53,040 / (1 - 0.48) = 77,941

Therefore, the total number of eligible voters was 77,941.

Final answer: E) -25%

Explanation:

The value of the house decreased by $100,000 from the initial price of $500,000 to the final price of $400,000.

To calculate the percentage change, we can use the formula:

Percentage change = (Final value - Initial value) / Initial value x 100%

Substituting the values, we get:

Percentage change = ($400,000 - $500,000) / $500,000 x 100%

Percentage change = -$100,000 / $500,000 x 100%

Percentage change = -20%

Therefore, the value of the house decreased by 20%.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the distances between the three contestants. Let's start by using the fact that A is 40 m ahead of B. This means that when B covers a certain distance, A has already covered that distance plus an additional 40 m. We can represent this relationship as:

B = A - 40

Next, we can use the fact that A is 64 m ahead of C. This means that when C covers a certain distance, A has already covered that distance plus an additional 64 m. We can represent this relationship as:

A = C + 64

Now, we can use these two relationships to solve for the distances covered by each contestant. Let's start by using the first relationship to solve for B when A covers a certain distance:

B = A - 40

Let's say A covers a distance of x. Then:

B = x - 40

Now, we can use the second relationship to solve for A when C covers a certain distance:

A = C + 64

Let's say C covers a distance of y. Then:

A = y + 64

Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the distances covered by all three contestants is equal to the total distance of the race, which is 1000 m:

A + B + C = 1000

Substituting the expressions we found for A and B, we get:

(y + 64) + (x - 40) + y = 1000

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2y + x - 40 = 1000

Now, we can use the fact that the distances covered by the contestants are all positive integers. We can start by trying different values for y and x that satisfy the equation, and checking if they result in positive integers for A and B.

Let's try y = 866 and x = 890. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

2(866) + 890 - 40 = 1000

This equation is true, and the distances covered by A, B, and C are all positive integers. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A = 866 m
B = 890 m
C = 836 m

Final answer: A covers 866 m, B covers 890 m, and C covers 836 m.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use algebra. Let's denote the two parts of 49 as x and y, where x is the greater part and y is the lesser part.

We know that the ratio of the greater part to the lesser part is 9 to 2. So, we can write:

x/y = 9/2

We also know that if the greater part is increased by 6 and the lesser part is decreased by 11, their ratio is still 9 to 2. So, we can write:

(x+6)/(y-11) = 9/2

Now, we can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the first equation, we can express y in terms of x:

y = (2/9)x

Substituting this expression for y into the second equation, we get:

((2/9)x + 6)/((2/9)x - 11) = 9/2

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x = 36

Substituting x = 36 into the expression for y, we get:

y = (2/9)(36) = 24

Therefore, the two parts of 49 are 36 and 24.

Final answer: The two parts of 49 are 36 and 24.

Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to use the concept of discounts and percentages. Let's denote the original price of the shoes as x.

Jay sold the shoes at a 15% gain, so the selling price is 1.15x.

His friend offered him a 5% discount, so the discount amount is 0.05(1.15x) = 0.0575x.

The final price that Jay received after the discount is 1.15x - 0.0575x = 1.0925x.

We are given that Jay sold the shoes for $218.50, so we can set up the equation:

1.0925x = $218.50

Solving for x, we get:

x = $218.50 / 1.0925
x = $200.00

Therefore, Jay originally bought his shoes for $200.00.

To solve this problem, we need to find the distance between P and Q. Let's denote this distance as D.

A cycled from P to Q at 10 kmph and returned at the rate of 9 kmph. B cycled both ways at 12 kmph.

Let's denote the time taken by A to cycle from P to Q as T1 and the time taken by B to cycle from P to Q as T2.

T1 = D / 10
T2 = D / 12

Since B took 10 minutes less than A, we can write:

T1 - T2 = 10 minutes

Substituting the expressions for T1 and T2, we get:

(D / 10) - (D / 12) = 10 minutes

Solving for D, we get:

D = 10 kmph x 10 minutes x 12 kmph / 10 kmph
D = 120 km

Therefore, the distance between P and Q is 120 km.

The ratio of the prices of the scooter and the television set is 3:2. If the scooter costs Rs.6000 more than the television set, then the price of the scooter is 3 times the price of the television set plus Rs.6000.

Let the price of the television set be x. Then the price of the scooter is 3x + Rs.6000.

Since the ratio of the prices is 3:2, we can write:

To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of ways to arrange the people seated at each table. Since there are 10 tables, we need to find the number of ways to arrange the people seated at each table.

Let's assume that there are n people seated at each table. Then, there are n! ways to arrange the people seated at each table. Since there are 10 tables, the total number of ways to arrange the people seated at all the tables is 10!n!.

However, we need to ensure that no chair is blank. This means that we need to make sure that there are always people seated at each table. To do this, we can fix one person at each table and then arrange the remaining people.

So, for each table, we need to choose one person out of n people to fix in place. This can be done in n ways. After fixing one person at each table, we need to arrange the remaining people. Since there are 10 tables, this can be done in 10! ways.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the people seated at all the tables so that no chair is blank is n! * 10! = n! * 10! * n = n!^2 * 10!.

Since we don't know the value of n, we need to find the smallest integer value of n such that n!^2 * 10! is greater than or equal to 10!.

By trial and error, we find that n = 4 satisfies this condition. Therefore, the final answer is E)10.

Final answer:

First, let's calculate the number of parcels that can be delivered by one man in one day.

For company A, each man can deliver 100 parcels in 5 days, so he can deliver 100/5 = 20 parcels in one day.

For company B, each man can deliver 100/5 = 20 parcels in one day.

Since company B is short of one man, they can only deliver 20 parcels per day with 4 men working.

Therefore, to deliver 100 parcels, company B will need 100/20 = 5 days.

Final answer: D. The correct option is D.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum time required for all four people to cross the river. We can do this by finding the maximum time required for any one person to cross the river and then adding that to the minimum time required for the other three people to cross.

The maximum time required for any one person to cross the river is 10 minutes. The minimum time required for the other three people to cross is 1+2+7=10 minutes.

Therefore, the shortest time needed for all four of them to cross the river is 10+10=20 minutes.

Final answer: 20 minutes.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum revenue that can be generated by Davji Shop. We can do this by considering different box sizes and calculating the revenue generated for each box size.

Let's start by considering a box size of 240 samosas. At this size, the price of the samosas would be Rs. 2 per samosa up to 200 samosas. This means that the price of the first 200 samosas would be Rs. 400 (200 x Rs. 2). For the remaining 40 samosas (240 - 200), the price would be Rs. 1.90 per samosa (Rs. 2 - 0.10 x 40). The revenue generated for this box size would be:

Revenue = (200 x Rs. 2) + (40 x Rs. 1.90) = Rs. 400 + Rs. 76 = Rs. 476

Now, let's consider a box size of 300 samosas. At this size, the price of the samosas would be Rs. 2 per samosa up to 220 samosas. This means that the price of the first 220 samosas would be Rs. 440 (220 x Rs. 2). For the remaining 80 samosas (300 - 220), the price would be Rs. 1.80 per samosa (Rs. 2 - 0.10 x 80). The revenue generated for this box size would be:

Revenue = (220 x Rs. 2) + (80 x Rs. 1.80) = Rs. 440 + Rs. 144 = Rs. 584

Finally, let's consider a box size of 400 samosas. At this size, the price of the samosas would be Rs. 2 per samosa up to 240 samosas. This means that the price of the first 240 samosas would be Rs. 480 (240 x Rs. 2). For the remaining 160 samosas (400 - 240), the price would be Rs. 1.70 per samosa (Rs. 2 - 0.10 x 160). The revenue generated for this box size would be:

Revenue = (240 x Rs. 2) + (160 x Rs. 1.70) = Rs. 480 + Rs. 256 = Rs. 736

Comparing the revenues generated for each box size, we can see that the maximum revenue is generated when the box size is 400 samosas, which is Rs. 736. Therefore, the maximum size of the box that would maximise the revenue is 400 samosas.

Final answer: The maximum size of the box that would maximise the revenue is 400 samosas.

Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to divide Rs.32000 in the ratio of 3:5.

Let's first find the sum of the parts of the ratio:

Sum of ratio parts = 3 + 5 = 8

Now, we can find the value of each part by dividing the total amount by the sum of the ratio parts:

Value of each part = Total amount / Sum of ratio parts

Value of each part = Rs.32000 / 8

Value of each part = Rs.4000

Now, we can find the amount of each part by multiplying the value of each part by the corresponding part of the ratio:

Amount of each part = Value of each part * Part of ratio

Amount of each part = Rs.4000 * 3

Amount of each part = Rs.12000

Amount of each part = Rs.4000 * 5

Amount of each part = Rs.20000

Therefore, the answer is:

Option D) 4000, 20000

Final answer:

To find the area of a rectangle, we can use the formula:
Area = Length x Width

We know that one side of the rectangular field is 4 m. We also know that the length along the diagonal is 5 m.

To find the length of the other side of the rectangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
a^2 + b^2 = c^2

We know that a = 4 m and c = 5 m. We can solve for b:
b^2 = c^2 - a^2
b^2 = 5^2 - 4^2
b^2 = 25 - 16
b^2 = 9
b = sqrt(9)
b = 3 m

Now we can find the area of the rectangle:
Area = Length x Width
Area = 4 m x 3 m
Area = 12 m^2

Therefore, the area of the rectangular field is 12 m^2.

Final answer: 12 m^2.

Final answer:
The company needs to offer an additional $15,000 to pay all the workers $65,000 each.

Explanation:
The company has a budget of $315,000 to distribute evenly among 5 employees. Each employee is demanding $65,000.

To find out how much more money the company needs to offer, we can subtract the total amount of money the company has from the total amount of money each employee is demanding:

$65,000 \* 5 - $315,000 = $325,000 - $315,000 = $10,000

Therefore, the company needs to offer an additional $10,000 to pay all the workers $65,000 each.

Final answer: The company needs to offer an additional $10,000 to pay all the workers $65,000 each.

Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to first calculate the cost of a kg of paper in 1978 and then calculate the cost of a kg of paper after 2 years.

First, let's calculate the cost of a kg of paper in 1978:

Cost of a kg of paper in 1978 = 1 kg x Rs25/- = Rs25

Next, let's calculate the cost of a kg of paper after 2 years. We know that the paper rate increases at 1.5% more than the inflation rate which is 6.5% a year. Therefore, the cost of a kg of paper after 2 years will be:

Cost of a kg of paper after 2 years = Cost of a kg of paper in 1978 x (1 + (Inflation rate + Increase rate))

Cost of a kg of paper after 2 years = Rs25 x (1 + (6.5% + 1.5%)) = Rs25 x (1 + 8%) = Rs25 x 1.08 = Rs25.80

Therefore, the cost of a kg of paper after 2 years will be Rs25.80.

Final answer: Rs25.80.

Final answer:

To find the cost of carpeting a room, we need to calculate the area of the room and the cost of the carpet.

The area of the room is:
Length x Width = 13 m x 9 m = 117 m^2

The cost of the carpet is:
Width x Length x Rate per square metre = 75 cm x 13 m x Rs. 12.40/m^2 = Rs. 1080

Therefore, the cost of carpeting the room is:
Area of the room x Cost of the carpet = 117 m^2 x Rs. 1080 = Rs. 117,880

Final answer: Rs. 117,880.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to find the three 2-digit prime numbers that satisfy the given conditions. We can start by listing all the 2-digit prime numbers:

23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97

We can then check which of these numbers satisfy the given conditions:

* If we add A and B, we get a number that is today's date. This means that A and B must be the first two digits of the current year. The only 2-digit prime numbers that satisfy this condition are 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23.
* If we add A and C, we get a number that is Caitlin's birthday this month. This means that A and C must be the first two digits of a number that is greater than or equal to the current year. The only 2-digit prime numbers that satisfy this condition are 17, 19, and 23.
* If we add B and C, we get a number that is Caitlin's birthday this month. This means that B and C must be the first two digits of a number that is less than or equal to the current year. The only 2-digit prime numbers that satisfy this condition are 13 and 19.

From these conditions, we can see that Caitlin's birthday this month must be either 17 or 19. Therefore, Caitlin got either 17 or 19.

Final answer: Caitlin got 17 or 19.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use algebra to represent the information given in the question. Let's use G for the number of girls, B for the number of boys, R for the number of right-handed girls, and L for the number of left-handed boys.

From the information given, we know that:

* G = 2B (twice as many girls as boys)
* R = 2L (twice as many right-handed girls as left-handed boys)

We also know that a sixth of the boys are left-handed, so:

* L = 0.16B

Now, we can substitute these relationships into the equations we have:

* G = 2B
* R = 2L

Substituting L = 0.16B into the second equation, we get:

* R = 2(0.16B)
* R = 0.32B

Substituting G = 2B and R = 0.32B into the first equation, we get:

* G = 2B
* G = 2(0.16B)
* G = 0.32B

Now we can substitute G = 0.32B and R = 0.32B into the equation we have for L:

* L = 0.16B
* L = 0.16(0.32B)
* L = 0.048B

Since we know that L = 0.16B, we can substitute this into the equation we have for R:

* R = 0.32B
* R = 0.32(0.16B)
* R = 0.048B

Since we know that G = 0.32B, we can substitute this into the equation we have for L:

* L = 0.048B
* L = 0.048(0.32B)
* L = 0.0144B

Since we know that R = 0.048B, we can substitute this into the equation we have for G:

* G = 0.32B
* G = 0.32(0.048B)
* G = 0.0144B

Now we can substitute all of these relationships into the equation we have for the number of right-handed girls:

* R = 0.048B
* R = 0.048(0.0144B)
* R = 0.0067B

Since we know that G = 0.0144B, we can substitute this into the equation we have for the number of left-handed boys:

* L = 0.0144B
* L = 0.0144(0.16B)
* L = 0.0023B

Since we know that R = 0.0067B, we can substitute this into the equation we have for the number of right-handed girls:

* R = 0.0067B

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of ways to select groups of applicants that include at least one non-employee. We can break this down into three cases:

1. One non-employee and two present employees:
Number of ways to choose one non-employee out of 6 is C(6,1) = 6.
Number of ways to choose two present employees out of 10 is C(10,2) = 45.
Total number of ways for this case is 6 * 45 = 270.

2. Two non-employees and one present employee:
Number of ways to choose two non-employees out of 6 is C(6,2) = 15.
Number of ways to choose one present employee out of 10 is C(10,1) = 10.
Total number of ways for this case is 15 * 10 = 150.

3. Three non-employees:
Number of ways to choose three non-employees out of 6 is C(6,3) = 20.
Total number of ways for this case is 20.

Adding up the total number of ways for all three cases, we get:
270 + 150 + 20 = 440.

Therefore, the final answer is E)60.

Final answer: E) $8.

Explanation:

1. Let G be the cost of glass lenses and P be the cost of plastic lenses.
2. We know that the total cost of an eye examination, frames, and glass lenses is $30.00, and the total cost of an eye examination, frames, and plastic lenses is $48.00.
3. From the given information, we can write two equations:

G + F + $30.00 = $48.00
P + F + $48.00 = $30.00

where F is the cost of frames.

4. We also know that the plastic lenses cost four times as much as the glass lenses, so we can write another equation:

P = 4G

5. Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation:

G + F + $30.00 = $48.00
(4G) + F + $48.00 = $30.00

6. Simplifying the equation, we get:

5G + F = $18.00

7. Since the cost of frames is constant, we can treat this equation as a linear equation in G.
8. Solving for G, we get:

G = $18.00 / 5 = $3.60

9. Therefore, the cost of glass lenses is $3.60.

Final answer: E) $8.

Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to set up an equation that represents the revenue generated by the salon spa loyalty program magazine before and after the price increase. Let's denote the number of subscribers before the price increase as x.

Before the price increase, the revenue generated by the magazine is:
Revenue = Program fee x

After the price increase, the revenue generated by the magazine is:
Revenue = (Program fee + $40) x

Since the magazine wants to collect the same revenue after the price increase as it did before, we can set up the following equation:

Program fee x = (Program fee + $40) x

Solving for x, we get:

x = (Program fee + $40) x / Program fee
x = (Program fee + $40) / (Program fee - $40)
x = (Program fee + $40) / $40

Final answer:

The green lizard can travel from the green cave to the blue cave in 72 minutes, so its speed is 1/72 = 0.01389 hours^-1.
The blue lizard can travel from the blue cave to the green cave in 25% less time, so its speed is 1/(1-0.25) = 0.75 hours^-1.
The green lizard started to travel 5.5 minutes before the blue lizard, so the blue lizard started at 72 - 5.5 = 66.5 minutes.
The green lizard will pass the middle line when it has traveled half the distance between the green and blue caves, which is 72/2 = 36 minutes.
Since the green lizard is traveling at 0.01389 hours^-1, it will take 36/0.01389 = 2604.44 minutes to travel 36 minutes.
Since the blue lizard is traveling at 0.75 hours^-1, it will take 36/0.75 = 48 minutes to travel 36 minutes.
The green lizard will pass the middle line 2604.44 - 48 = 2556.44 minutes after the blue lizard started.
Therefore, the green lizard will pass the middle line 2556.44 minutes after the blue lizard started.

Final answer: 2556.44 minutes after the blue lizard started.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of combinations. The number of handshakes will be the number of ways to choose 2 people out of 8 to shake hands. This can be calculated using the formula for combinations:

nCr = n! / [(n-r)!r!]

where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes factorial.

In this case, n = 8 and r = 2. So, we have:

8C2 = 8! / [(8-2)!2!]
= 8! / [6!2!]
= (8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / [(6*5*4*3*2*1)*(2*1)]
= 28

Therefore, there will be 28 handshakes.

Final answer: C)28.

Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to determine the rate at which Mary and Lisa can paint a house together. Let's call Mary's rate "m" and Lisa's rate "l".

1. We know that Mary can paint a house in 4 hours, so her rate is 1/4 houses per hour.
2. When they work together, they can paint a house in 3 hours, so their combined rate is 1/3 houses per hour.
3. To find their individual rates, we can set up a proportion: m/1 = l/3
4. Solving for "l", we get l = 3m/4
5. Since they can paint a house in 3 hours together, we know that 3 * (3m/4) = 1
6. Simplifying, we get 9m/4 = 1
7. Solving for "m", we get m = 4/9
8. Since Lisa can paint a house in 4 hours by herself, her rate is 1/4 houses per hour.
9. To find out how long it would take for Lisa to paint a house by herself, we can set up another proportion: l/1 = 4/9
10. Solving for "l", we get l = 9/4

Therefore, it would take Lisa 9/4 hours or 2.25 hours to paint a house by herself.

Final answer: B)6 hr. The correct option is B.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to find the number of boys in the school. We know that there are twice as many girls as boys, and that each day 900 bows are completed.

Let's start by using the information about the number of bows to find the total number of people in the school. Since each girl and boy bows to each other, we can assume that the total number of bows is equal to the sum of the number of bows each person completes.

So, if we let G be the number of girls and B be the number of boys, then:

G + B + 1 = 900

We also know that there are twice as many girls as boys, so we can write:

G = 2B

Now we can substitute this expression for G into the first equation:

2B + B + 1 = 900

Combining the terms on the left side gives:

3B + 1 = 900

Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:

3B = 899

Dividing both sides by 3 gives:

B = 333

So there are 333 boys in the school.

Final answer: There are 333 boys in the school.

Final answer:

To estimate the time needed to fill the bath tub, we need to determine the rate at which the taps fill the tub and the rate at which the lid empties the tub.

Let's first calculate the rate at which the cold water tap fills the tub:

* The cold water tap can fill the tub in 6 hours.
* Therefore, the rate at which the cold water tap fills the tub is 1/6 of a tub per hour.

Next, let's calculate the rate at which the hot water tap fills the tub:

* The hot water tap can fill the tub in approximately 4 hours.
* Therefore, the rate at which the hot water tap fills the tub is 1/4 of a tub per hour.

Since both taps are open, the combined rate at which they fill the tub is the sum of their individual rates:

* Combined rate = 1/6 + 1/4 = 5/12 of a tub per hour.

Now, let's calculate the rate at which the lid empties the tub:

* The lid can empty the tub in exact 13 hours.
* Therefore, the rate at which the lid empties the tub is 1/13 of a tub per hour.

Since both taps are open and the lid is also emptying the tub, the net rate at which the tub is being filled is the combined rate minus the rate at which the lid empties the tub:

* Net rate = 5/12 - 1/13 = 45/132 of a tub per hour.

To estimate the time needed to fill the tub, we need to divide the volume of the tub by the net rate:

* Volume of the tub = 1 (since we are estimating the time needed to fill the tub completely)
* Time needed to fill the tub = Volume of the tub / Net rate = 1 / (45/132) = 132/45 = 3 hours

Therefore, the estimated time needed to fill the bath tub is 3 hours.

Final answer: E. The correct option is E.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of sheep equally among the 6 children. Let's denote the number of sheep that the man will keep to himself as x. Then, the number of sheep that will be divided among the 6 children is 43 - x.

Since the man wants to divide the sheep equally, we can write the equation:

(43 - x) / 6 = 1

Solving for x, we get:

43 - x = 6
x = 37

Therefore, the man should keep 37 sheep to himself, so as to equally divide the remaining 7 sheep among his 6 children.

Final answer: The man should keep 37 sheep to himself.

Final answer:

To solve this question, we need to first understand the given information. The necklace is currently priced at $179.95 and will be sold at a 50% off sale next week. This means that the necklace will be sold for $179.95 \* (1 - 0.5) = $89.98 next week.

However, we want to find out the price of the necklace this week. Since the necklace is currently priced at $179.95 and will be sold for $89.98 next week, we can assume that the necklace is being sold at a discount of $179.95 - $89.98 = $89.97 this week.

Therefore, the price of the necklace this week is $89.97.

Final answer: $89.97.
