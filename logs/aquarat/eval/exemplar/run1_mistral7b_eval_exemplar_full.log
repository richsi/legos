Now, you will be provided with some example questions.
Question: In a certain animal population, for each of the first 3 months of life, the probability that an animal will die during that month is 1/4. For a group of 200 newborn members of the population, approximately how many would be expected to survive the first 3 months of life?
Options:
A)40
B)46
C)52
D)62
E)85
Reasoning: The probability of survival for each of the first 3 months of life is 1-1/4=3/4, so of 200 newborn 200*3/4 *3/4*3/4=~85 is expected to survive.
Answer: E.. The correct option is E.

Question: A starts walking at 4 kmph and 4 hours after his start B starts cycling at 10 kmph. After how much distance will B catch up with A
Options:
A)26.2 km
B)25.7 km
C)23.2 km
D)26.67 km
E)None of these
Reasoning: Explanation:
Distance travelled by each of them is to be made equal.
=> Distance travelled walking = Distance covered cycling.
Let after 4 hours of walking, A walk for x hours more before B catches up with him.
=> Distance = Speed * Time
(4+x)4 = 10x
x = 8/3
Therefore, It takes B 8/3 hours to catch up with A. Distance: 8/3 x 10 = 80/3 km = 26.67
ANSWER: D. The correct option is D.

Question: From the integer n, if n*n*n is odd, then what is true from below options?
Options:
A)n is odd
B)n is odd and n*n is even
C)n is even
D)n*n is even
E)n*n odd
Reasoning: n is odd and n*n is even
Option B. The correct option is B.

Question: Rs.8000 become Rs.9261 in a certain interval of time at the rate of 5% per annum of C.I. Find the time?
Options:
A)10years
B)12 years
C)5 years
D)3 years
E)24 years
Reasoning: Explanation:
9261 = 8000(21/20)N
(21/20)3 = (21/20)N => N = 3 years
Answer:D. The correct option is D.

Question: Look at this series: 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, ... What number should come next?
Options:
A)7
B)10
C)14
D)15
E)16
Reasoning: Explanation: This alternating addition series begins with 3; then 1 is added to give 4; then 3 is added to give 7; then 1 is added, and so on.
Answer: Option D. The correct option is D.

Now, you will be provided with the evaluation question. Provide your final answer in a newline following "Final answer: ".
Question: Three birds are flying at a fast rate of 900 kilometers per hour. What is their speed in miles per minute? [1km = 0.6 miles]
Options:
A)32400
B)6000
C)600
D)60000
E)10

(PROMPT END)
Final answer: D. The correct option is D.
