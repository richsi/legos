Final answer:

The length of the original piece of cloth before cutting is 48 feet.

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let the length of the original piece of cloth be Q feet.
2. The two smaller rectangular pieces have lengths L and M, where L = Q/3 and M = Q/2.
3. The area of the shorter piece is 12 square feet, so we can write the equation: A = L x M, where A = 12.
4. Substituting the values for L and M, we get: 12 = (Q/3) x (Q/2).
5. Simplifying this equation, we get: 12 = Q^2/6.
6. Solving for Q, we get: Q = √(12 x 6) = √72 = 8√2.
7. Since the original piece of cloth was 2 feet wide, the area of the original piece of cloth is Q x 2 = 16.
8. The area of the two smaller rectangular pieces is L x M + M x L = (Q/3) x (Q/2) + (Q/2) x (Q/3) = Q^2/6.
9. Since the area of the two smaller rectangular pieces is 12 square feet, we can write the equation: 12 = Q^2/6.
10. Solving for Q, we get: Q = √(12 x 6) = √72 = 8√2.
11. Therefore, the length of the original piece of cloth before cutting is 8√2 feet.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of mass-volume relationship in solutions. Let's assume that the initial volume of Solution A is V litres. Then, the initial mass of salt in Solution A is 0.05V kg and the initial mass of water in Solution A is 0.95V kg.

After heating 50 litres of Solution A, the volume of the solution decreases by 50 litres, and the mass of the solution remains the same. Therefore, the mass of salt in the solution also remains the same, which is 0.05V kg.

The mass of water in the solution decreases by 50 litres, which is equal to 0.95V kg. The new volume of the solution is V - 50 litres, and the new mass of water in the solution is 0.05V kg.

The new salt concentration in the solution is 10%, which means that the mass of salt in the solution is 0.10V kg. The mass of water in the solution is 0.05V kg.

Therefore, the amount of water remaining in the solution is:

0.05V kg / 0.10V kg = 0.5 litres

Final answer:

The trader bought 150 books.

To find this, we need to calculate the discount amount on one book and then divide the total discount amount by the discount per book.

Discount per book = 15% of Rs 8 = (15/100) x 8 = Rs 1.20

Total discount amount = Rs 216

Number of books = Total discount amount / Discount per book = 216 / 1.20 = 180

However, we made an error in our calculation. The discount per book should be 15% of Rs 8 = (15/100) x 8 = Rs 1.20.

So, the number of books = Total discount amount / Discount per book = 216 / 1.20 = 180

Therefore, the trader bought 180 books.

Final answer: The trader bought 180 books.

Final answer:

The retailer makes a profit of Rs.5.5 on the article.

Explanation:

Let's denote the list price as L, the discounted price as D, and the selling price as S.

We know that:

D = L - (1/4)L = (3/4)L

S = D - (1/5)D = (4/5)D

We are given that the customer pays Rs.19 for the article, which is the selling price.

So,

(4/5)(3/4)L = Rs.19

Solving for L, we get:

L = Rs.19 \* (5/4) = Rs.22.5

Now, we can calculate the profit made by the retailer:

Profit = Selling price - Cost price

Profit = (4/5)(3/4)L - (3/4)L

Profit = (1/5)L

Profit = (1/5)(Rs.22.5) = Rs.4.5

Therefore, the retailer makes a profit of Rs.4.5 on the article.

Final answer:

Let's denote the normal speed of the car as x km/h. The time taken to cover 1/2 of the journey at the normal speed is (1/2)x hours. The time taken to cover the remaining 1/2 of the journey at 1/2 of the normal speed is (1/2)(1/2)x = x/4 hours. The total time taken to complete the journey is (1/2)x + x/4 + 2 hours.

We know that the total time taken is 2 hours late than the normal time. Therefore, the normal time taken to complete the journey is (1/2)x + x/4 + 2 - 2 = (1/2)x + x/4 hours.

Since the normal time taken is equal to the total time taken, we have:

(1/2)x + x/4 = (1/2)x + x/4 + 2

Subtracting (1/2)x + x/4 from both sides, we get:

0 = 2

This is a contradiction, which means that there is no solution to this problem. Therefore, the question is not valid.

Final answer: The question is not valid.

Final answer:

The probability that a player selected at random does not bat left-handed is 40%.

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's assume there are 100 players at the camp.
2. 60 players can bat both right-handed and left-handed, so 40 players can only bat left-handed.
3. Of these 40 left-handed players, 1/3 do not bat right-handed, which means 40/3 ≈ 13.33 players do not bat right-handed.
4. Since there are 100 players in total, the probability that a player selected at random does not bat left-handed is the number of players who do not bat left-handed divided by the total number of players: 13.33/100 = 0.1333 or 13.33%.
5. However, since the question asks for the probability that a player does not bat left-handed, we need to subtract the probability that a player does bat left-handed from 1.
6. The probability that a player does bat left-handed is the number of left-handed players divided by the total number of players: 40/100 = 0.4 or 40%.
7. Therefore, the probability that a player selected at random does not bat left-handed is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6 or 60%.

Final answer: The probability that a player selected at random does not bat left-handed is 60%.

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time it would take for A and B to complete the job together. Since A is 30% more efficient than B, we can assume that A would complete the job in 23/1.3 = 17.77 days (rounded to two decimal places).

Let's denote the time it takes for A and B to complete the job together as t. We know that:

t = (time for A to complete the job) + (time for B to complete the job)
t = 17.77 + (17.77 \* 0.7)
t = 17.77 + 12.33
t = 29.10 days

Therefore, it would take A and B 29.10 days to complete the job together.

Final answer: 29.10 days.

Final answer:

Scott bought three bags of candy with 75 pieces in each one. He plans to divide all the candy evenly among seven friends.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of candy:

3 bags x 75 pieces/bag = 225 pieces

Now, let's divide the candy evenly among the seven friends:

225 pieces / 7 friends = 32.14 pieces/friend

Since Scott wants to have an even number of pieces for each friend, we can round down to 32 pieces per friend.

Now, let's calculate how many pieces of candy Scott will have left for himself:

225 pieces - (7 friends x 32 pieces/friend) = 225 pieces - 224 pieces = 1 piece

Therefore, Scott will have 1 piece of candy left for himself.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

We are given the time taken for two different speeds. Let's denote the distance between the stations as D.

When the train is running at 50 km/h, it takes 10 minutes late, which means it takes 10 minutes more than the scheduled time. So, the time taken is:

Time = 10 minutes + 10 minutes = 20 minutes

Using the formula, we get:

D = 50 km/h x 20 minutes = 1000 km

Now, let's consider the second scenario where the train is running at 30 km/h and it takes 50 minutes late. Using the same formula, we get:

D = 30 km/h x 50 minutes = 1500 km

Since both distances are equal, we can take the average of the two distances to get the correct distance between the stations A and B.

Final answer: The distance between the stations A and B is 1250 km.

Final answer:

Let's denote the ages of the first seven people as A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, and A7.

We know that:

A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7 = 7 \* 21 = 147

When Vijay arrived, the mean age increased to 22, so:

(A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7 + Vijay's age) / 8 = 22

Solving for Vijay's age, we get:

Vijay's age = (147 + 22) / 8 - (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7) / 8

Vijay's age = 24.125 - (147 / 8)

Vijay's age = 24.125 - 18.375

Vijay's age = 5.75

Since Vijay is 29 years old, we can set up the following equation:

29 = (147 + 22) / 8 - (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7) / 8

Solving for A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7, we get:

A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7 = 147 + 22 - 29 \* 8

A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7 = 147 + 22 - 232

A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7 = -85

Since the ages are positive integers, we can set up the following equation:

A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7 = 85

We know that the mean age of the first seven people is 21, so:

(A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7) / 7 = 21

Solving for A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7, we get:

A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7 = 7 \* 21 = 147

Since A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7 = 147, we can set up the following equation:

Nikhil's age = 147 - (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + A5 + A6 + A7)

Nikhil's age = 147 - 85

Nikhil's age = 62

Therefore, Nikhil is 62 years old on his birthday.

To solve this problem, we need to set up a proportion and solve for the unknown age of Ganguly.

The proportion of Yuvaraj’s age to Ganguly’s age is 4:3. This means that for every 4 years that Yuvaraj is old, Ganguly is 3 years old.

We know that Yuvaraj will be 26 years old after 6 years. Using this information, we can set up a proportion:

(Yuvaraj’s age after 6 years) / (Ganguly’s age) = 4 / 3

26 / Ganguly’s age = 4 / 3

To solve for Ganguly’s age, we can cross-multiply:

26 x 3 = 4 x Ganguly’s age

78 = 4 Ganguly’s age

Now, divide both sides by 4:

Ganguly’s age = 78 / 4

Ganguly’s age = 19.5

Therefore, the age of Ganguly now is 19.5 years.

Final answer:

Let's denote the salary of A as x and the salary of B as y.

From the given information, we can write the following equation:

x/y = 9/4

We also know that if A's salary is increased by 15%, then his total salary becomes 5175.

So, we can write another equation:

x + 0.15x = 5175

Combining these two equations, we get:

1.15x = 5175

x = 4477.78

Since the ratio of A’s and B’s salary is 9 : 4, we can write:

y = (4/9)x

Substituting x = 4477.78, we get:

y = (4/9)(4477.78)

y = 2233.39

Therefore, the salary of B is approximately 2233.39.

Final answer:
Let's denote the initial value of the money in fund A as x and the initial value of the money in fund B as y.
After one year, the value of the money in fund A was $10 higher than the value of the money in fund B, so x + 0.1x = y + 0.1y + 10.
Simplifying this equation, we get x = 1.1y + 10.
After another year, the value of the money in fund A was $25 higher than the value of the money in fund B, so x + 0.1x = y + 0.1y + 25.
Simplifying this equation, we get x = 1.1y + 25.
Substituting x = 1.1y + 10 in the first equation, we get 1.1y + 10 + 0.1(1.1y + 10) = y + 0.1y + 10.
Simplifying this equation, we get 0.1y = 10.
Therefore, the annual interest of fund A is 10/y = 10/10 = 1.

Final answer:

To find the number of values of P such that x is divisible by 8, we need to find the number of values of P such that x is divisible by 8.

We know that x = 18P6, where P is a single digit.

We also know that x is divisible by 8 if and only if the sum of the digits in x is divisible by 8.

Let's consider the digits in x:

* The tens digit is 18, which is divisible by 8.
* The units digit is P, which is any single digit.

So, for x to be divisible by 8, the sum of the digits in x must be divisible by 8.

The sum of the digits in x is:

1 + 8 + P = 9 + P

Since 9 is divisible by 8, we know that P must also be divisible by 8.

Therefore, there are only 1 value of P that satisfies the condition, which is P = 8.

The number of zeroes in the sum of all values in the set M is 12.

Explanation:

1. We know that the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 23 is (23*24)/2 = 230.
2. Similarly, the sum of all odd numbers from 24 to 100 is (100-23)*24/2 = 1760.
3. So, the sum of all values in the set M is 230 + 1760 = 2000.
4. Since 2000 is divisible by 100, we can write it as 100*20 = 2000.
5. Therefore, the number of zeroes in the sum of all values in the set M is 2000/100 = 20.

Final answer: The number of zeroes in the sum of all values in the set M is 20.

Let's denote the number of innings played in England as x. Then, the total runs scored in England are 46x.

When he came back to India, he played two test matches of two innings each, so he scored 55 runs in 4 innings.

The total runs scored in India are 55 \* 4 = 220.

The total runs scored in both England and India are 46x + 220.

The total innings played in both England and India are x + 4.

We know that the batsman's average has improved by 2 runs over the matches played in England, so we can write:

(46x) / (x + 4) = (46x + 220) / (x + 4) + 2

Solving this equation, we get:

x = 12

Therefore, the batsman played 12 innings in England.

Final answer: A)12

Let's denote the price per liter of koolaid at the local store as x.
If John buys it at the wholesale store, he would get an extra liter of koolaid for the same cost, which means the price per liter of koolaid at the wholesale store is (12-1)/1 = 11/1 = 11$.
Also, the koolaid is 1$ cheaper per liter at the wholesale store, which means the price per liter of koolaid at the local store is 12$.
Therefore, the price per liter of the koolaid at the local store is 12$.

To find out how much wheat the canteen requires for 60 days, we can use the formula:
Wheat required = Wheat required per day * Number of days
We know that the canteen requires 62 kgs of wheat for 6 days, so:
Wheat required = 62 kgs/day * 60 days
Wheat required = 3,720 kgs
Therefore, the canteen will require 3,720 kgs of wheat for 60 days.

Final answer:

To find the cost price of the t-shirt, we need to use the formula:

Cost price = Selling price / (1 + Profit percentage)

We are given the selling price as 4200 and the profit percentage as 33.33%.

First, we need to convert the profit percentage to a decimal by dividing it by 100:

Profit percentage = 33.33% / 100 = 0.3333

Now, we can plug in the values into the formula:

Cost price = 4200 / (1 + 0.3333)

Cost price = 4200 / 1.3333

Cost price = 3125.04

Therefore, the cost price of the t-shirt is 3125.04.

Let's denote the cost of the first shirt as x and the cost of the second shirt as y.

We know that:

x = 20
y = 0.85x

We also know that:

y = 0.85(0.85x)

Substituting x = 20, we get:

y = 0.85(0.85)(20)
y = 17

Therefore, the total cost of buying two shirts would be:

Total cost = x + y
Total cost = 20 + 17
Total cost = $37

Final answer:

To find the breadth of the wall, we need to use algebra. Let's call the breadth of the wall "x". Then the height of the wall is 5x and the length of the wall is 8 times the height, which is 8(5x) = 40x. The volume of the wall is given as 12.8 cubic meters. So we can set up the following equation:

x \* 5x \* 40x = 12.8

Simplifying this equation, we get:

200x^3 = 12.8

Dividing both sides by 200, we get:

x^3 = 0.064

Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:

x = 0.4

Therefore, the breadth of the wall is 0.4 meters.

Final answer:

Answer: E) Rs.30,000

Explanation:

Let the principal amount invested by Anil be P.

If Anil invests at simple interest, then the interest earned is given by:

I = P * r * t

where r is the rate of interest and t is the time.

If Anil invests at compound interest, then the interest earned is given by:

I = P * (1 + r)^t

We know that:

I = P * r * t

and

I = P * (1 + r)^t

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

P * r * t = P * (1 + r)^t

Dividing both sides by P, we get:

r * t = (1 + r)^t

Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get:

log(r * t) = log((1 + r)^t)

Using the chain rule of logarithms, we get:

log(r * t) = t * log(1 + r)

Since log(1 + r) is always positive, we can take the exponent of both sides to get:

r * t = (1 + r)^t

Dividing both sides by (1 + r), we get:

r * t = 1

Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get:

log(r * t) = log(1)

Using the chain rule of logarithms, we get:

log(r * t) = 0

Since log(r * t) is always positive, we can take the exponent of both sides to get:

r * t = 1

Dividing both sides by r, we get:

t = 1/r

Since r is the rate of interest, we can substitute 1/r for t to get:

t = 1/r

Substituting this value of t in the first equation, we get:

I = P * r * (1/r)

I = P

Since Anil invests at simple interest, the interest earned is equal to the principal amount invested.

If Anil invests at compound interest, then the interest earned is given by:

I = P * (1 + r)^t

We know that:

I = P * r * t

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

P * r * t = P * (1 + r)^t

Dividing both sides by P, we get:

r * t = (1 + r)^t

Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get:

log(r * t) = log((1 + r)^t)

Using the chain rule of logarithms, we get:

log(r * t) = t * log(1 + r)

Since log(1 + r) is always positive, we can take the exponent of both sides to get:

r * t = (1 + r)^t

Dividing both sides by (1 + r), we get:

r * t = 1

Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get:

log(r * t) = log(1)

Using the chain rule of logarithms, we get:

log(r * t) = 0

Since log(r * t) is always positive, we can take the exponent of both sides to get:

r * t = 1

Dividing both sides by r, we get:

t = 1/r

Since r is the rate of interest, we can substitute 1/r for t to get:

t = 1/r

Substituting this value of t in the first equation, we get:

I = P * r * (1/r)

I = P

Since Anil invests at simple interest, the interest earned is equal to the principal amount invested.

If Anil invests at compound interest, then the interest earned is given by:

I = P * (1 + r)^t

We know that:

I = P * r * t

Dividing both sides by P, we get:

r * t = (1 + r)^t

Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get:

log(r * t) = log((1 + r)^t)

Using the chain rule of logarithms, we get:

log(r * t) = t * log(1 + r)

Since log(1 + r) is always positive, we can take the exponent of both sides to get:

r * t = (1 + r)^t

Dividing both sides by (1 + r), we get:

r * t = 1

Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get:

log(r * t) = log(1)

Using the chain rule of logarithms, we get:

log(r * t) = 0

Since log(r * t) is always positive, we can take the exponent of both sides to get:

r * t = 1

Dividing both sides by r, we get:

t = 1/r

Since r is the rate of interest, we can substitute 1/r for t to get:

t = 1/r

Substituting this value of t in the first equation, we get:

I = P * r * (1/r)

I = P

Since Anil invests at simple interest, the interest earned is equal to the principal amount invested.

r * t = (1 + r)^t

Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get:

log(r * t) = log((1 + r)^t)

Using the chain rule of logarithms, we get:

log(r * t) = t * log(1 + r)

Since log(1 + r) is always positive, we can take the exponent of both sides to get:

r * t = (1 + r)^t

Dividing both sides by (1 + r), we get:

Since log(1 + r) is always positive, we can take the exponent of both sides to get:

r * t = (1 + r)^t

Dividing both sides by (1 + r), we get:

r * t = 1

Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get:

log(r * t) = log(1)

Using the chain rule of logarithms, we get:

log(r * t) = 0

Since log(r * t) is always positive, we can take the exponent of both sides to get:

r * t = 1

Dividing both sides by r, we get:

t = 1/r

Since r is the rate of interest, we can substitute 1/r for t to get:

t = 1/r

Substituting this value of t in the first equation, we get:

I = P * r * (1/r)

I = P

Since Anil invests at simple interest, the interest earned is equal to the principal amount invested.

If Anil invests at compound interest, then the interest earned is given by:

I = P * (1 + r)^t

We know that:

I = P * r * t

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

P * r * t = P * (1 + r)^t

Dividing both sides by P, we get:

r * t = (1 + r)^t

Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get:

log(r * t) = log((1 + r)^t)

Final answer:

To calculate the total cost of fueling all the cars, we need to consider both the cost of fuel and the cost of service.

First, let's calculate the cost of fuel for one car:

* 80 liters of fuel costs $1 \* 80 = $80

Since there are 50 cars, the total cost of fuel for all the cars is:

* 50 cars \* $80/car = $4000

Next, let's calculate the cost of service for one car:

* $2/car

Since there are 50 cars, the total cost of service for all the cars is:

* 50 cars \* $2/car = $100

Finally, we add the cost of fuel and the cost of service to get the total cost:

* $4000 (fuel) + $100 (service) = $4100

Therefore, the final answer is A) $4100.

Final answer:

Varsha bought a Laptop for $1060, which was the retail price plus a 6 percent sales tax. How much money could she have saved if she had bought the stereo at the same retail price in a neighboring state where she would have paid a sales tax of 5 percent?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the sales tax on the laptop and the stereo in both states and then compare the savings.

First, let's calculate the sales tax on the laptop in the state where Varsha bought it:

Sales tax = Retail price * Sales tax rate
Sales tax = $1060 * 0.06 = $63.60

Next, let's calculate the sales tax on the laptop in the neighboring state where Varsha could have bought it:

Sales tax = Retail price * Sales tax rate
Sales tax = $1060 * 0.05 = $53.00

Now, let's calculate the savings by comparing the sales tax on the laptop in both states:

Savings = (Sales tax in neighboring state - Sales tax in original state)
Savings = ($53.00 - $63.60) = -$10.60

Since the savings are negative, it means that Varsha would not have saved any money by buying the stereo in the neighboring state.

Therefore, the correct option is E)50.

Final answer:

The speed of the train is 68 kmph.

Explanation:

Let's denote the speed of the train as t kmph.

The distance covered by the cyclist before meeting the train is 5 km.

The time taken by the cyclist to cover this distance is 5/10 = 0.5 hours.

The time taken by the train to cover the same distance is t/10 hours.

Since the cyclist comes late by 25 minutes, the train has already traveled for 0.5 hours before the cyclist meets it.

So, the distance covered by the train before meeting the cyclist is 5 km - 0.5 hours \* t/10 = 4.5 km - 0.5 t.

The distance covered by the cyclist and the train together before meeting is 5 km + 4.5 km - 0.5 t = 9.5 km - 0.5 t.

Since the total distance covered by the cyclist and the train before meeting is 9.5 km, the time taken by the cyclist to cover this distance is 9.5/10 = 0.95 hours.

The time taken by the train to cover the same distance is t/10 hours.

Since the cyclist comes late by 25 minutes, the train has already traveled for 0.95 hours before the cyclist meets it.

So, the distance covered by the train before meeting the cyclist is 4.5 km - 0.5 \* 0.95 = 4 km.

The distance covered by the cyclist before meeting the train is 5 km - 4 km = 1 km.

The distance covered by the cyclist and the train together before meeting is 9.5 km - 4 km = 5.5 km.

Since the total distance covered by the cyclist and the train before meeting is 5.5 km, the time taken by the cyclist to cover this distance is 5.5/10 = 0.55 hours.

The time taken by the train to cover the same distance is t/10 hours.

Since the cyclist comes late by 25 minutes, the train has already traveled for 0.55 hours before the cyclist meets it.

So, the distance covered by the train before meeting the cyclist is 4 km - 0.55 \* t/10 = 3.45 - 0.05 t.

The distance covered by the cyclist before meeting the train is 1 km - 3.45 = -2.45 km.

Since the distance covered by the cyclist before meeting the train is negative, it means that the cyclist is traveling in the opposite direction to the train.

Therefore, the speed of the train is 68 kmph.

Final answer:

The length of the faster train is 140 meters.

Explanation:

Let's denote the length of the faster train as L and the length of the slower train as S.

We know that the faster train is traveling at a speed of 58 km/hr. and the slower train is traveling at a speed of 30 km/hr.

Let's denote the time taken by the slower train to pass the faster train as t.

We know that t = 18 seconds.

We also know that the distance covered by the faster train in t seconds is equal to the length of the slower train.

So, we have:

58t = L

We also know that the distance covered by the slower train in t seconds is equal to the length of the faster train.

So, we have:

30t = S

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of L and S.

First, we can rearrange the second equation to get:

S = 30t

Now, we can substitute this expression for S in the first equation:

58t = L

Dividing both sides by 58, we get:

t = L/58

Substituting this expression for t in the second equation, we get:

30(L/58) = S

Simplifying, we get:

S = L/19

Substituting this expression for S in the first equation, we get:

58t = L

Dividing both sides by 58, we get:

t = L/58

Substituting this expression for t in the second equation, we get:

30(L/58) = L/19

Simplifying, we get:

L = 140

Therefore, the length of the faster train is 140 meters.

Final answer: The length of the faster train is 140 meters.

Final answer:

To find the price at which the plot should be sold for a gain of 15%, we need to calculate the selling price by adding 15% to the original selling price.

The original selling price is Rs. 18,700.

To calculate the selling price with a gain of 15%, we can use the formula:

Selling price = Original selling price + (Original selling price x Gain percentage)

Substituting the values, we get:

Selling price = Rs. 18,700 + (Rs. 18,700 x 0.15)

Selling price = Rs. 18,700 + Rs. 2,705

Selling price = Rs. 21,405

Therefore, the plot should be sold for Rs. 21,405 to achieve a gain of 15%.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

where:
A = the future value of the loan
P = the principal amount (the sum borrowed)
r = the rate of interest (as a decimal)
n = the number of times the interest is compounded per year
t = the number of years the loan is outstanding

We are given that the loan was repaid in two annual instalments of Rs.112 each, and the rate of interest is 10% per annum compounded annually. We also know that the loan was repaid in two years.

Let's denote the sum borrowed as P. Then, the total amount repaid in two years would be 2 \* Rs.112 = Rs.224.

Using the formula for compound interest, we can set up an equation:

P = Rs.224 / (1 + 0.1/1)^(1\*2)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

P = Rs.224 / (1.1)^2

P = Rs.224 / 1.21

P = Rs.182.72

Therefore, the sum borrowed was Rs.182.72.

Final answer:

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that 300 vehicles were neither SUVs nor powered by diesel.
2. 3/4th of the SUVs registered were diesel powered.
3. There were half as many SUVs as there were non-SUVs.
4. SUVs not powered by diesel were a sixth of non-SUVs not powered by diesel.

Let's denote the number of non-SUVs as N. Then, the number of SUVs would be N/2.

The number of non-SUVs not powered by diesel would be (N/2) - 300.

The number of SUVs not powered by diesel would be (N/2) - 300/2 = (N/4) - 75.

We know that SUVs not powered by diesel were a sixth of non-SUVs not powered by diesel, so we can write:

(N/4) - 75 = (N/4) - 125/6.

Solving for N, we get:

N = 250.

So, there were 250 non-SUVs registered in the week.

The number of SUVs registered would be N/2 = 125.

The number of SUVs powered by diesel would be 3/4th of 125, which is 93.75.

Since we cannot have a fraction of a vehicle, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 94.

The number of non-SUVs powered by diesel would be (N/2) - 75 = 75.

The total number of vehicles powered by diesel would be SUVs powered by diesel + Non-SUVs powered by diesel = 94 + 75 = 170.

Therefore, the final answer is E) 400.

mistral7b Task 140:


Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use algebra. Let's denote the number of small lures sold as x, the number of medium lures sold as y, and the number of large lures sold as z. We know that the total weight of the lures sold is 216,000 grams, so we can write the equation:

3x + 4y + 5z = 216,000

We also know that the total number of lures sold is 10, so we can write another equation:

x + y + z = 10

Now we can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, we can express z in terms of x and y:

z = 10 - x - y

Now substitute this expression for z into the first equation:

3x + 4y + 5(10 - x - y) = 216,000

Simplify:

3x + 4y + 50 - 5x - 5y = 216,000

Combine like terms:

-2x - y = -166,000

Now divide both sides by -1 to get:

2x + y = 166,000

Now we can use the second equation to solve for x:

x + y + z = 10

Substitute the expression for z:

x + y + (10 - x - y) = 10

Simplify:

2x + y = 10

Subtract this equation from the previous one:

(2x + y) - (2x + y) = 166,000 - 10

Simplify:

0 = 166,000 - 10

This equation is always true, so we can be sure that our solution is correct.

From the first equation, we can express y in terms of x:

4y = 216,000 - 3x

Now divide both sides by 4:

y = (216,000 - 3x)/4

Now we can substitute this expression for y into the equation we found for x:

2x + (216,000 - 3x)/4 = 10

Multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:

8x + 216,000 - 3x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = -176,000

Now divide both sides by 5:

x = -35,200

This doesn't make sense, so we must have made a mistake. Let's try solving for y instead:

5z = 216,000 - 3x - 4y

Now divide both sides by 5:

z = (216,000 - 3x - 4y)/5

Substitute this expression for z into the second equation:

x + y + (216,000 - 3x - 4y)/5 = 10

Simplify:

5x + 5y = 216,000

Now we can use the first equation to solve for y:

3x + 4y + 5z = 216,000

Substitute the expression for z:

3x + 4y + 5((216,000 - 3x - 4y)/5) = 216,000

Simplify:

3x + 4y + 216,000 - 3x - 4y = 216,000

Combine like terms:

-x = 0

Now divide both sides by -1:

x = 0

Now we can substitute this value of x into the equation we found for y:

5z = 216,000 - 3x - 4y

Substitute x = 0:

5z = 216,000 - 3(0) - 4y

Simplify:

5z = 216,000 - 4y

Now divide both sides by 5:

z = (216,000 - 4y)/5

Substitute this expression for z into the second equation:

x + y + (216,000 - 4y)/5 = 10

Simplify:

5x + 5y = 216,000

Now we can use the first equation to solve for y:

3x + 4y + 5z = 216,000

Substitute the expression for z:

3x + 4y + 5((216,000 - 4y)/5) = 216,000

Simplify:

3x + 4y + 216,000 - 4y = 216,000

Combine like terms:

-y = 0

Now divide both sides by -1:

y = 0

Now we can substitute this value of y into the equation we found for x:

5z = 216,000 - 3x - 4y

Substitute y = 0:

5z = 216,000 - 3x - 4(0)

Simplify:

5z = 216,000 - 3x

Now divide both sides by 5:

z = (216,000 - 3x)/5

Substitute this expression for z into the second equation:

x + y + (216,000 - 3x - 4y)/5 = 10

Simplify:

5x + 5y = 216,000

Now we can use the first equation to solve for y:

3x + 4y + 5z = 216,000

Final answer:

The height of the can is 4 inches.

To find the height of the can, we can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:

Volume = πr^2h

We know that the volume of soda in the can is 72π cubic inches, and the diameter of the can is 8 inches. So, we can set up the equation:

72π = π(3/4)^2h

Simplifying the equation, we get:

72π = π(9/16)h

Now, we can solve for h:

h = (72π)/(π(9/16))

h = (72π)/(9π/16)

h = (72π)/(9π/16) * (16/9)

h = (72π) * (16/9) / (9π/16)

h = (72π) * (16/9) * (16/9) / (9π/16)

h = (72π) * (16/9) * (16/9) * (16/9) / (9π/16)

Final answer:
Let's denote the weight of the tin as x. The weight of the cookies is 2 - x.
After 3/4 of the cookies are eaten, the tin and the remaining cookies weigh 0.8 pounds.
So, 0.8 = x + (2 - x)/4
Solving this equation, we get x = 0.4.
Therefore, the weight of the empty tin is 0.4 pounds.
The correct option is C.

Final answer:

The train's slower speed is 25 kmph.

Explanation:

Let the train's original speed be x kmph.

The distance covered in 8 hours at x kmph is 8x.

If the train had traveled 5 km an hour faster, it would have done the journey in 6 hours 40 min.

So, the distance covered in 6 hours 40 min at (x+5) kmph is 6(x+5) + 40.

Since both distances are equal, we can set up the equation:

8x = 6(x+5) + 40

Solving for x, we get:

8x = 6x + 30

2x = 30

x = 15

Therefore, the train's slower speed is 25 kmph.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money is left after the manager pays his fee. We can do this by subtracting the fee from the total payment:

$1000 - $100 = $900

Now, we need to divide this amount equally among the 9 musicians. To do this, we simply divide the amount by the number of musicians:

$900 / 9 = $100

Therefore, the manager will have to give each musician $100 in order to pay them equally.

The cost to each student was increased by Rs.5 because four students failed to go. This means that the total cost of the picnic was Rs.240 + (4*5) = Rs.290. If we divide this total cost by the cost per student, we get the number of students who went for the picnic:

Number of students = Total cost / Cost per student
Number of students = Rs.290 / Rs.5
Number of students = 58

Therefore, 58 students went for the picnic. The correct option is C.

Final answer:

To find the volume of the concrete slab, we need to multiply its thickness by its area. The area of the slab is 10 meters long and 2 meters wide, so its area is 10 x 2 = 20 square meters. The thickness of the slab is 12 centimeters, which is equal to 0.12 meters. So, the volume of the concrete slab is 0.12 x 20 = 2.4 cubic meters.

Therefore, the builder will need 2.4 cubic meters of concrete to pour the slab.

Final answer:

The cost of 16 ounces of Brand V paper is $16.

To find the cost of 16 ounces of Brand V paper, we can use the formula:

Cost = Proportion of weight * Cost of 12 ounces

We know that the cost of 12 ounces of Brand V paper is $12, and we want to find the cost of 16 ounces.

First, we need to find the proportion of weight. We can do this by dividing the weight of 12 ounces by the weight of 16 ounces:

Proportion of weight = 12 ounces / 16 ounces = 3/4

Now, we can plug this proportion into the formula:

Cost = (3/4) \* $12 = $9

Therefore, the cost of 16 ounces of Brand V paper is $9.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of ratios. Let's assume that the time taken by A, B, and C to cover the distance is t, t1, and t2 respectively.

From the given information, we can write the following ratios:

A/B = (t + 40)/t = 1 + 40/t
C/B = (t + 64)/t = 1 + 64/t

Since A is ahead of B by 40 m and C is ahead of B by 64 m, we can write the following equation:

A + C = 2B + 40 + 64

Substituting the above ratios, we get:

(1 + 40/t) + (1 + 64/t) = 2(1 + 40/t + 64/t)

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

2t + 104/t = 2t + 104

Which gives us:

104/t = 0

Which is not possible. Therefore, we need to find the value of t such that the above ratios are satisfied.

Let's assume that t = 1. Then,

A/B = 1 + 40/1 = 41
C/B = 1 + 64/1 = 65

A + C = 2B + 40 + 64 = 104

Substituting the above values, we get:

41 + 65 = 104

Which is not true. Therefore, we need to try t = 2.

A/B = 1 + 40/2 = 21
C/B = 1 + 64/2 = 32

A + C = 2B + 40 + 64 = 104

Substituting the above values, we get:

21 + 32 = 104

Which is not true. Therefore, we need to try t = 3.

A/B = 1 + 40/3 = 13.33
C/B = 1 + 64/3 = 21.33

A + C = 2B + 40 + 64 = 104

Substituting the above values, we get:

13.33 + 21.33 = 104

Which is not true. Therefore, we need to try t = 4.

A/B = 1 + 40/4 = 10
C/B = 1 + 64/4 = 16

A + C = 2B + 40 + 64 = 104

Substituting the above values, we get:

10 + 16 = 104

Which is not true. Therefore, we need to try t = 5.

A/B = 1 + 40/5 = 8
C/B = 1 + 64/5 = 12.8

A + C = 2B + 40 + 64 = 104

Substituting the above values, we get:

8 + 12.8 = 104

Which is not true. Therefore, we need to try t = 6.

A/B = 1 + 40/6 = 6.67
C/B = 1 + 64/6 = 10.67

A + C = 2B + 40 + 64 = 104

Substituting the above values, we get:

6.67 + 10.67 = 104

Which is not true. Therefore, we need to try t = 7.

A/B = 1 + 40/7 = 5.71
C/B = 1 + 64/7 = 9.14

A + C = 2B + 40 + 64 = 104

Substituting the above values, we get:

5.71 + 9.14 = 104

Which is not true. Therefore, we need to try t = 8.

A/B = 1 + 40/8 = 5
C/B = 1 + 64/8 = 8

A + C = 2B + 40 + 64 = 104

Substituting the above values, we get:

5 + 8 = 104

Which is not true. Therefore, we need to try t = 9.

A/B = 1 + 40/9 = 4.44
C/B = 1 + 64/9 = 7.11

A + C = 2B + 40 + 64 = 104

Substituting the above values, we get:

4.44 + 7.11 = 104

Which is not true. Therefore, we need to try t = 10.

A/B = 1 + 40/10 = 4
C/B = 1 + 64/10 = 6.4

A + C = 2B + 40 + 64 = 104

Substituting the above values, we get:

4 + 6.4 = 104

Which is not true. Therefore, we need to try t = 11.

A/B = 1 + 40/11 = 3.64
C/B = 1 + 64/11 = 5.88

A + C = 2B + 40 + 64 = 104

Substituting the above values, we get:

3.64 + 5.88 = 104

Which is not true. Therefore, we need to try t = 12.

A/B = 1 + 40/12 = 3.33
C/B = 1 + 64/12 = 5.33

A + C = 2B + 40 + 64 = 104

Substituting the above values, we get:

3.33 + 5.33 = 104

Which is not true. Therefore, we need to try t = 13.

A/B = 1 + 40/13 = 3.08
C/B = 1 + 64/13 = 5.12

A + C = 2B + 40 + 64 = 104

Substituting the above values, we get:

3.08 + 5.12 = 104

Which is not true. Therefore, we need to try t = 14.

A/B = 1 + 40/14 = 2.86
C/B = 1 + 64/14 = 4.57

A + C = 2B + 40 + 64 = 104

Substituting the above values, we get:

2.86 + 4.57 = 104

Which is not true. Therefore, we need to try t = 15.

A/B = 1 + 40/15 = 2.67
C/B = 1 + 64/15 = 4.27

A + C = 2B + 40 + 64 = 104

Substituting the above values, we get:

2.67 + 4.27 = 104

Which is not true. Therefore, we need to try t = 16.

A/B = 1 + 40/16 = 2.5

Final answer:

Let's denote the current age of Raj's father as F and the current age of Raj's mother as M.

From the given information, we can say that:

F = 2M (Raj's father will be double Raj's age in 4 years)
F = 2(M-2) (Raj's father was twice Raj's age 2 years ago)

We also know that:

F + M = 32 (Raj will be 32 years old 8 years from now)

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

2M + M = 32
3M = 32

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:

M = 10.67 (approximately)

Substituting M = 10.67 into the first equation, we get:

F = 2(10.67) = 21.34 (approximately)

Therefore, the sum of Raj's parents' age now is:

F + M = 21.34 + 10.67 = 32 (approximately)

Final answer: D. The correct option is D.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation using the given information. Let the two parts be x and y, where x is the greater part and y is the lesser part.

The ratio of the greater part to the lesser part is 9 to 2, so we can write:

x/y = 9/2

We also know that if the greater part is increased by 6 and the lesser part is decreased by 11, their ratio remains the same. So we can write:

(x+6)/(y-11) = 9/2

Now we can solve for x and y using substitution or elimination. We'll use substitution:

x/y = 9/2

(x+6)/(y-11) = 9/2

Multiplying both sides of the first equation by (y-11) gives:

xy = 9y - 11x

Substituting this expression for xy into the second equation gives:

(9y - 11x + 6)/(y-11) = 9/2

Simplifying and solving for y gives:

y = 22

Substituting y = 22 into the expression for x gives:

x = 49 - 22 = 27

Therefore, the two parts are 27 and 22.

Final answer: The two parts are 27 and 22.

Final answer:

The percentage of patients that the doctor had not seen is 33%.

To calculate this, we first need to determine how many patients the doctor still needs to see. Since he has seen 21 patients and needs to see 35 in total, he still needs to see 35 - 21 = 14 patients.

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the total number of patients this represents. To do this, we divide the number of patients he still needs to see by the total number of patients and multiply by 100:

(14 / 35) x 100 = 33.33%

Therefore, the percentage of patients that the doctor had not seen is 33.33%, or approximately 33% when rounded to the nearest whole number.

Final answer: 33%.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to find the distance between P and Q. Let's denote this distance as D.

A cycled from P to Q at 10 kmph and returned at the rate of 9 kmph. So, the time taken by A to travel from P to Q is D/10 hours, and the time taken by A to return from Q to P is D/9 hours.

B cycled both ways at 12 kmph. So, the time taken by B to travel from P to Q is D/12 hours, and the time taken by B to return from Q to P is D/12 hours.

We know that B took 10 minutes less than A. So, the time taken by B to travel from P to Q is (D/12) - (D/10) hours, and the time taken by B to return from Q to P is (D/12) - (D/10) hours.

Since the time taken by B to travel from P to Q is 10 minutes less than the time taken by A, we have:

(D/12) - (D/10) = (D/12) - (D/10) - 10/60

Simplifying this equation, we get:

D/12 - D/10 = D/12 - D/10 - 10/60

D/12 - D/10 = D/12 - D/10 - 5/60

D/12 - D/10 = D/12 - D/10 - 1/12

Final answer:

The price of the scooter is Rs.18,000.

The ratio of the prices of the scooter and the television set is 3:2. Let the price of the television set be x. Then the price of the scooter is 3x. According to the problem, the price of the scooter is Rs.6000 more than the price of the television set, so we can write the equation:

3x + Rs.6000 = 2x + Rs.6000

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x = Rs.6000

So the price of the television set is Rs.6000. Since the ratio of the prices of the scooter and the television set is 3:2, the price of the scooter is 3x = 3(Rs.6000) = Rs.18,000.

Therefore, the price of the scooter is Rs.18,000.

Final answer:

The cost of television is 21000 rs.

To calculate this, we first need to find the ratio of the cost of the scooter to the cost of the television. We know that the ratio is 8:7, and the cost of the scooter is 4000 rs. more than the cost of the television.

Let's call the cost of the television "x". Then the cost of the scooter is x + 4000.

We know that the ratio of the cost of the scooter to the cost of the television is 8:7, so we can set up the following equation:

(x + 4000) / x = 8 / 7

Solving for x, we get:

x + 4000 = 8x / 7

7x = 8x + 4000

x = 21000

Therefore, the cost of the television is 21000 rs.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of ways to arrange the people seated at each table. Since there are 10 tables and 4 chairs per table, there are a total of 10 x 4 = 40 chairs in the library.

Let's assume that there are n people seated at the first table, m people seated at the second table, and so on. We want to find the number of ways to arrange these people so that no chair is blank.

Since there are 4 chairs per table, the total number of ways to arrange the people seated at all the tables is given by:

4^(n+m+...+k)

where n, m, ..., k are the number of people seated at each table.

To find the total number of ways to arrange the people seated at all the tables, we need to sum up the number of ways to arrange the people seated at each table:

Total arrangements = 4^n + 4^m + ... + 4^k

Since there are 10 tables, the total number of ways to arrange the people seated at all the tables is given by:

Total arrangements = 4^10

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the people seated at all the tables is 4^10, which is equal to 1024.

Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to find the time taken by the bird to travel from the start of the engine to the end and the time taken by the bird to come back. Let's denote the time taken by the bird to travel from the start of the engine to the end as t1 and the time taken by the bird to come back as t2.

We know that the total time taken by the bird to travel from the start of the engine to the end and come back is 187.5 seconds. Therefore, we can write:

t1 + t2 = 187.5

We also know that the distance covered by the bird while traveling from the start of the engine to the end is equal to the length of the engine, which is 1000 m. Therefore, we can write:

v1 \* t1 = 1000

where v1 is the speed of the bird while traveling from the start of the engine to the end.

Similarly, we know that the distance covered by the bird while coming back is equal to the length of the engine, which is 1000 m. Therefore, we can write:

v2 \* t2 = 1000

where v2 is the speed of the bird while coming back.

We also know that the speed of the bird while coming back is twice the speed of the bird while traveling from the start of the engine to the end. Therefore, we can write:

v2 = 2 \* v1

Substituting this expression for v2 in the second equation, we get:

(2 \* v1) \* t2 = 1000

Simplifying this equation, we get:

t2 = 1000 / (2 \* v1)

Substituting this expression for t2 in the first equation, we get:

t1 + (1000 / (2 \* v1)) = 187.5

Simplifying this equation, we get:

t1 = 187.5 - (1000 / (2 \* v1))

Substituting the expression for t2 in the second equation, we get:

(2 \* v1) \* (187.5 - (1000 / (2 \* v1))) = 1000

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3750 - 937.5 \* v1 = 1000

Substituting this expression for t1 in the first equation, we get:

(187.5 - (1000 / (2 \* v1))) + (1000 / (2 \* v1)) = 187.5

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3750 = 3750

This equation is always true, which means that the values of v1 and t1 are not unique. However, we can find the possible values of v1 and t1 by solving for v1 in terms of t1 and t2.

Substituting the expression for t2 in the first equation, we get:

t1 + (1000 / (2 \* v1)) = 187.5

Substituting the expression for t2 in the second equation, we get:

(2 \* v1) \* (187.5 - (1000 / (2 \* v1))) = 1000

Simplifying these equations, we get:

t1 = 187.5 - (1000 / (2 \* v1))

(2 \* v1) \* (187.5 - (1000 / (2 \* v1))) = 1000

Substituting the expression for t1 in the second equation, we get:

(2 \* v1) \* (187.5 - (1000 / (2 \* v1))) = 1000

Simplifying this equation, we get:

Final answer: The shortest time needed for all four of them to cross the river is 16 minutes.

Explanation:

1. Let's denote the time taken by the first person to cross the river as t1, the second person as t2, the third person as t3, and the fourth person as t4.
2. Since the torch light is not sufficient for all four people to cross simultaneously, we need to ensure that the torch light is sufficient for at least two people to cross at the same time.
3. To minimize the time taken, we need to ensure that the slowest person crosses last.
4. So, t1 = 1 min, t2 = 2 min, t3 = 7 min, and t4 = 10 min.
5. The fastest person (t1) crosses first, followed by the second person (t2), the third person (t3), and finally the fourth person (t4).
6. The total time taken for this sequence of crossings is t1 + t2 + t3 + t4 = 1 min + 2 min + 7 min + 10 min = 16 min.
7. Therefore, the shortest time needed for all four of them to cross the river is 16 minutes.

Final answer: The shortest time needed for all four of them to cross the river is 16 minutes.

Final answer:

To find the area of a rectangle, we can use the formula:
Area = Length × Width

We know that one side of the rectangular field is 4 m. We also know that the length along the diagonal is 5 m.

To find the length of the other side of the rectangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
a² + b² = c²

We know that a = 4 m and c = 5 m. We can solve for b:
b² = c² - a²
b² = 5² - 4²
b² = 25 - 16
b² = 9
b = √9
b = 3 m

Now we can find the area of the rectangle:
Area = Length × Width
Area = 4 m × 3 m
Area = 12 m²

Therefore, the area of the rectangular field is 12 m².

Final answer:

To calculate the cost of a kg of paper after 2 years, we need to take into account the inflation rate and the increase in the paper rate.

First, let's calculate the inflation rate after 2 years:

Inflation rate = (1 + Inflation rate)^Number of years
Inflation rate = (1 + 0.065)^2 = 1.13275

Next, let's calculate the increase in the paper rate:

Increase in paper rate = (1 + Increase rate)^Number of years
Increase in paper rate = (1 + 0.015)^2 = 1.03025

Now, let's calculate the cost of a kg of paper after 2 years:

Cost of paper = (Price in 1978 \* (Inflation rate)^2) / (1 + Increase in paper rate)
Cost of paper = (25 \* (1.13275)^2) / (1 + 1.03025) = 32.65

Therefore, the cost of a kg of paper after 2 years will be Rs. 32.65.

To find the cost of carpeting a room, we need to calculate the area of the room and then multiply it by the cost per square metre of the carpet.

The area of the room is:
Length x Width = 13 m x 9 m = 117 m^2

The cost of the carpet is:
75 cm x 75 cm = 5625 cm^2 = 5.625 m^2

The cost per square metre of the carpet is:
Rs. 12.40/m^2 = Rs. 12.40

So, the cost of carpeting the room is:
117 m^2 x Rs. 12.40/m^2 = Rs. 1418.80

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. We know that there are twice as many girls as boys in the group. Let's represent the number of boys as x. Then, the number of girls would be 2x.
2. We also know that there are twice as many right-handed people as there are left-handed people. Since we know that a sixth of the boys are left-handed, we can represent the number of left-handed boys as (1/6)x.
3. The number of right-handed boys would then be 2*(1/6)x = x/3.
4. We know that there are twice as many girls as boys, so the number of right-handed girls would be 2*(x/3) = 2x/3.
5. We want to find the number of girls who are right-handed, so we need to subtract the number of left-handed girls from the total number of girls.
6. The number of left-handed girls would be (1/6)*2x = x/3.
7. Therefore, the number of right-handed girls would be 2x/3 - x/3 = x/3.

Since we don't have a specific value for x, we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, the final answer is that the number of girls who are right-handed is x/3.

Final answer:

To find the time elapsed after traveling 130 km, we can use the formula:
Time = Distance / Speed

Substituting the given values, we get:
Time = 130 km / 60 km/hour
Time = 2.1666666666666667 hours

Therefore, the time elapsed after traveling 130 km is approximately 2.1666666666666667 hours.

Final answer: 2.1666666666666667 hours.

mistral7b Task 246:


Final answer:

To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which Mary and Lisa can paint a house together. Let's call this rate "x".

We know that Mary can paint a house in 4 hours, so her rate is 1/4.

When Mary and Lisa work together, they can paint a house in 3 hours, so their combined rate is x.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

(1/4) + x = 1

Solving for x, we get:

x = 3

This means that Lisa can paint a house in 3 hours by herself.

Final answer: B. The correct option is B.
