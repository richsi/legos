Here are the new rules that I came up with:

RULE 4: When evaluating a question with multiple steps, ensure that each step's reasoning is self-contained and can be verified independently of the others.

RULE 5: When comparing different options, verify that the correct answer's rationale is consistent with the mathematical operations and assumptions made during the reasoning process.

RULE 6: When working with percentages, ensure that the calculation is based on the correct base value and that the percentage change is accurately applied to the relevant quantity.

RULE 7: When analyzing a series or sequence, identify the underlying pattern or rule that governs the progression and apply it to predict the next value.

These new rules aim to address specific challenges in the AquaRat dataset, such as evaluating multi-step questions, verifying option rationales, working with percentages, and identifying patterns in series. They complement the existing rules and provide additional guidance for the agent to accurately answer complex questions. 

Please let me know if these new rules meet your expectations. 

Also, I'd like to know if you'd like me to generate more rules or if these are sufficient to help the agent answer the AquaRat questions. 

Please let me know how I can further improve the rules or if there's anything else I can assist you with.

You are an advanced reasoning agent that can add, edit, or remove rules from your existing rule set, based on new insights or expansions.

Here is your existing rule set:
RULE 1: Break the question into its fundamental components by isolating key sub-questions and identifying the underlying assumptions or facts required to solve each step.
RULE 2: When decomposing a question, identify the key elements of the question and the facts provided to
