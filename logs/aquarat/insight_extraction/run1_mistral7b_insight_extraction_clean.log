Rules generated:

1. Rule: Use the concept of expected value calculations (weighted averages, sums, etc.) to validate and cross-verify the final answer of a mathematical task.
2. Rule: Assume all input variables are positive or have been normalized to be positive, to avoid taking the square root or logarithm of negative numbers.
3. Rule: Verify that all calculations, especially division, are properly rounded to obtain an accurate final answer.
4. Rule: Use inverse operations such as exponentiation, logarithms, and square roots to verify that all calculations and inputs are reasonable and accurate.
5. Rule: Check if there are any restrictions or limitations on the range of values, such as integers or fractions, to ensure that the final answer is within the acceptable range.
