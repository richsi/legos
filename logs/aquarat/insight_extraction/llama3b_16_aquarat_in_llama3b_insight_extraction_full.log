You are an advanced reasoning agent that can add, edit, or remove rules from your existing rule set, based on new insights or expansions.

Here is your existing rule set:
RULE 1: Break the question into its fundamental components by isolating key sub-questions and identifying the underlying assumptions or facts required to solve each step.
RULE 2: When decomposing a question, identify the key elements of the question and the facts provided to ensure Use the provided facts to build logical connections between each step, validating that every inference aligns with the available evidence and the overall question context.
RULE 3: Ensure that the final answer is consistent with the step-by-step decomposition by cross-verifying each reasoning step, confirming that all parts contribute coherently to the final conclusion.

Now, you are given mathematical tasks from the AquaRat dataset. Each task has:
• A Question
• Options to select an answer from
• The rationale for the correct answer
• The correct answer

Each new rule should be:

1. Clear and concise, focusing on how to break down the question and verify the final answer.
2. Helping in ensuring the reasoning steps are valid and that the final answer is accurate.

Now, you will be provided examples to base these rules off of.
Examples: 
Question: In a certain animal population, for each of the first 3 months of life, the probability that an animal will die during that month is 1/4. For a group of 200 newborn members of the population, approximately how many would be expected to survive the first 3 months of life?
Options:
A)40
B)46
C)52
D)62
E)85
Reasoning: The probability of survival for each of the first 3 months of life is 1-1/4=3/4, so of 200 newborn 200*3/4 *3/4*3/4=~85 is expected to survive.
Answer: E.. The correct option is E.

Question: A starts walking at 4 kmph and 4 hours after his start B starts cycling at 10 kmph. After how much distance will B catch up with A
Options:
A)26.2 km
B)25.7 km
C)23.2 km
D)26.67 km
E)None of these
Reasoning: Explanation:
Distance travelled by each of them is to be made equal.
=> Distance travelled walking = Distance covered cycling.
Let after 4 hours of walking, A walk for x hours more before B catches up with him.
=> Distance = Speed * Time
(4+x)4 = 10x
x = 8/3
Therefore, It takes B 8/3 hours to catch up with A. Distance: 8/3 x 10 = 80/3 km = 26.67
ANSWER: D. The correct option is D.

Question: From the integer n, if n*n*n is odd, then what is true from below options?
Options:
A)n is odd
B)n is odd and n*n is even
C)n is even
D)n*n is even
E)n*n odd
Reasoning: n is odd and n*n is even
Option B. The correct option is B.

Question: Rs.8000 become Rs.9261 in a certain interval of time at the rate of 5% per annum of C.I. Find the time?
Options:
A)10years
B)12 years
C)5 years
D)3 years
E)24 years
Reasoning: Explanation:
9261 = 8000(21/20)N
(21/20)3 = (21/20)N => N = 3 years
Answer:D. The correct option is D.

Question: Look at this series: 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12,... What number should come next?
Options:
A)7
B)10
C)14
D)15
E)16
Reasoning: Explanation: This alternating addition series begins with 3; then 1 is added to give 4; then 3 is added to give 7; then 1 is added, and so on.
Answer: Option D. The correct option is D.

Your job is to generate exactly five concise new insights (i.e., RULES) that would help an agent correctly answer any complex AquaRat question. 
Each insight should be a clear, high-level guideline that will aid in answering the example questions. Ensure that there are no empty rules.
Make sure each rule is presented as a single line or sentence and that it complements (or updates) the existing RULES above. Avoid repetition.
(PROMPT END)
 

Here are the new rules that I came up with:

RULE 4: When evaluating a question with multiple steps, ensure that each step's reasoning is self-contained and can be verified independently of the others.

RULE 5: When comparing different options, verify that the correct answer's rationale is consistent with the mathematical operations and assumptions made during the reasoning process.

RULE 6: When working with percentages, ensure that the calculation is based on the correct base value and that the percentage change is accurately applied to the relevant quantity.

RULE 7: When analyzing a series or sequence, identify the underlying pattern or rule that governs the progression and apply it to predict the next value.

These new rules aim to address specific challenges in the AquaRat dataset, such as evaluating multi-step questions, verifying option rationales, working with percentages, and identifying patterns in series. They complement the existing rules and provide additional guidance for the agent to accurately answer complex questions. 

Please let me know if these new rules meet your expectations. 

Also, I'd like to know if you'd like me to generate more rules or if these are sufficient to help the agent answer the AquaRat questions. 

Please let me know how I can further improve the rules or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
