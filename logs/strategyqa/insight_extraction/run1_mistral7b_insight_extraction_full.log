(PROMPT START)
You are an advanced reasoning agent that can add, edit, or remove rules from your existing rule set, based on new insights or expansions.

Here is your existing rule set:
RULE 1: Break the question into its fundamental components by isolating key sub-questions and identifying the underlying assumptions or facts required to solve each step.
RULE 2: When decomposing a question, identify the key elements of the question and the facts provided to ensure Use the provided facts to build logical connections between each step, validating that every inference aligns with the available evidence and the overall question context.
RULE 3: Ensure that the final answer is consistent with the step-by-step decomposition by cross-verifying each reasoning step, confirming that all parts contribute coherently to the final conclusion.

Now, you are given StrategyQA dataset tasks. Each task has:
• A Question
• A set of Facts
• An Answer
• A Decomposition (a step-by-step outline of how the question might be solved)

Your job is to generate between 5 and 15 concise new insights (i.e., rules or directions) that would help an agent correctly answer any complex StrategyQA question. Each new rule should be:

1. Generally applicable to tasks involving a Question, Facts, Answer, and Decomposition.
2. Clear and concise, focusing on how to break down the question, leverage the facts, and verify the final answer.
3. Helpful in ensuring the reasoning steps are valid and that the final answer is accurate.

Examples:
Facts: ['All purpose flour has about 9% gluten in it.', 'When someone with Celiac disease eats gluten, their body has an immune response that attacks their small intestine.']
Question: Is All Purpose Flour safe for someone who has celiac disease?
Answer:
Sub-question 1: What do people with celiac disease have to avoid?
Sub-question 2: Is #1 absent from all purpose flour?
The answer is: No

Facts: ['Adam Mickiewicz was a Polish poet. ', "Adam Mickiewicz 's sonnet sequence focuses heavily on the culture and Islamic religion of the Crimean Tatars."]
Question: Did a Polish poet write sonnets about Islamic religion?
Answer:
Sub-question 1: What were the major focus of Adam Mickiewicz's sonnets?
Sub-question 2: Is #1 about Islamic religion?
Sub-question 3: Was Adam Mickiewicz a Polish poet?
Sub-question 4: Are #2 and #3 positive?
The answer is: Yes

Facts: ['A black widow woman refers to a woman who murders her husbands for money and remarries.', 'Peach pits contain amygdalin, a type of cyanide.', 'Cyanide is poisonous to humans.']
Question: Would a black widow woman have use for peaches?
Answer:
Sub-question 1: What is a black widows main goal?
Sub-question 2: What do peach pits contain?
Sub-question 3: If a human ate #2, would #1 occur?
The answer is: Yes

Facts: ['Leipzig is derived from the Slavic word Lipsk', 'Lipsk means "settlement where the linden trees stand"', 'Linden trees are deciduous trees']
Question: Is the tree species that the name Leipzig refers to an evergeen tree?
Answer:
Sub-question 1: Which species of tree is mentioned in the meaning of the name (of a city) Leipzig?
Sub-question 2: Classifying by seasonal traits, what kind of tree is #1?
Sub-question 3: Is being evergreen a characteristic of #2?
The answer is: No

Facts: ['The crucifix is a symbol of Christianity', "The vast majority of Pakistan's population is Muslim"]
Question: Are you likely to find a crucifix in Karachi?
Answer:
Sub-question 1: What religion does a crucifix symbolize?
Sub-question 2: What is the main religion observed in Karachi, Pakistan?
Sub-question 3: Is #1 the same as #2?
The answer is: No


Based on the provided task description and examples, generate between 5 and 15 new or updated rules.
Each insight should be a clear, high-level guideline that strengthens the reasoning process.
Ensure that there are no empty rules.
Make sure each rule is presented as a single line or sentence and that it complements (or updates) the existing rules above. Avoid repetition.
Please provide these new or revised rules below in the format: RULE <number>: <rule>, starting with number 1.
(PROMPT END)

RULE 1: Identify the main idea or thesis of the question to keep the reasoning on track and avoid getting sidetracked.
RULE 2: Before decomposing the question, identify any special considerations or requirements (e.g., contextual or scope-related) to ensure the solution is grounded in the appropriate set of facts.
RULE 3: When building logical connections between the sub-questions, be mindful of any potential contradictions or competing considerations, and ensure that each inference is consistent with the available evidence and the overall question context.
RULE 4: When validating a final answer, consider how it integrates with the overall reasoning process and the contextual and scope-related requirements outlined in RULE 2, and ensure that all logic is sound.
RULE 5: Avoid relying too heavily on a single piece of evidence for a conclusion, and consider the overall reliability of all sources and their potential biases.
RULE 6: When working with a set of given facts, prioritize the most relevant information or the most significant facts based on their potential impact on the final answer.
RULE 7: When synthesizing information, pay attention to any patterns or commonalities in the facts to identify potential connections and relationships between the sub-questions.
RULE 8: Before making a final determination, assess the potential implications or consequences of each possible inference or decision, and consider their overall relevance to the question context.
RULE 9: In cases where multiple possible answers exist, provide an explanation or a rationale for your preference, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each option.
RULE 10: Ensure all intermediate reasoning steps are explicitly stated, allowing the user to understand the reasoning process and any potential assumptions that might be involved.
RULE 11: When assessing the reliability of a fact or a source, consider whether it comes from a reputable or an objective source, as well as whether it's supported by other evidence.
RULE 12: Pay attention to any linguistic or lexical cues that might reveal the main theme or framework of the question, helping to guide the reasoning process.
RULE 13: To ensure the reasoning is comprehensive, consider any missing or incomplete information that might affect the final answer and look for opportunities to gather additional facts or clarify uncertainties.
RULE 14: Keep an open mind when working with complex or ambiguous questions, and be prepared to adapt your reasoning approach based on new insights or information as they become available.
RULE 15: Finally, always verify that the final answer matches the context of the question and is consistent with the given facts and the decomposition, ensuring the overall solution is both valid and relevant.
