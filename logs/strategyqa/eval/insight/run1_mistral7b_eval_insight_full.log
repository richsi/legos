Now, you will be provided with the evaluation question and fact(s) below.
Facts: 
Human overpopulation results from the birthrate exceeding the death rate in a country.
Rusev is a professional wrestler who was born in Bulgaria.
The population of Bulgaria decreased by .7% in 2018.

Question: Does Rusev have to worry about human overpopulation in his homeland?
(PROMPT END)
Question: Does Rusev have to worry about human overpopulation in his homeland?
Thoughts:
1. First, we need to determine whether Bulgaria is experiencing human overpopulation. To do this, we need to compare the birthrate and death rate in Bulgaria.
2. According to the facts provided, the birthrate in Bulgaria is not mentioned. However, we know that the population decreased by .7% in 2018. This suggests that the death rate may be higher than the birthrate, which could lead to a decline in the population.
3. However, we also need to consider the context of the question. Rusev is a professional wrestler who was born in Bulgaria. Therefore, we need to determine whether he is still living in Bulgaria or not.
4. Unfortunately, the facts provided do not mention whether Rusev is still living in Bulgaria. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether he has to worry about human overpopulation in his homeland.
Final Answer: No, we cannot definitively say whether Rusev has to worry about human overpopulation in his homeland based on the provided facts.

Now, you will be provided with the evaluation question and fact(s) below.
Facts: 
Olive oil is a fat used in cooking.
Olive oil is made up of palmitic acid which is a weak acid found in plants and animals.
Rabies is a disease from an infected animal bite.
Rabies is treated by a shot containing immunoglobuin, a protein that is found in plasma cells.
Plasma cells are found in the bone marrow of humans.

Question: Can olive oil kill rabies?
(PROMPT END)
Question: Can olive oil kill rabies?
Thoughts:
RULE 1: The key elements of the question are "olive oil" and "rabies." The facts provided are "olive oil is a fat used in cooking," "olive oil is made up of palmitic acid," "rabies is a disease from an infected animal bite," and "rabies is treated by a shot containing immunoglobuin."
RULE 2: The provided facts do not directly mention olive oil's ability to kill rabies. However, we can use the information about palmitic acid to build a logical connection. Palmitic acid is a weak acid found in plants and animals, and it is not known to be toxic to humans. Therefore, it is unlikely that olive oil, which is primarily composed of palmitic acid, would have the ability to kill rabies.
RULE 3: The final answer is consistent with the step-by-step decomposition. Olive oil is not known to be toxic to humans, and it is unlikely that it would have the ability to kill rabies.
Final Answer: No.

Question: Can Kit & Kaboodle hypothetically help someone past the Underworld gates?
Thoughts:
The question asks if Kit & Kaboodle can help someone past the Underworld gates. The Underworld is guarded by Cerberus, a three-headed dog that eats the raw flesh of anyone that tries to escape. Kit & Kaboodle is a brand of cat food.
First, we need to identify the key elements of the question and the facts provided. The key elements of the question are the ability of Kit & Kaboodle to help someone past the Underworld gates, and the fact that Cerberus guards the Underworld and eats anyone who tries to escape. The fact provided is that Kit & Kaboodle is a brand of cat food.
Next, we need to build logical connections between each step, validating that every inference aligns with the available evidence and the overall question context. Since Kit & Kaboodle is a brand of cat food, it is unlikely that it can help someone past the Underworld gates, as it is not designed for that purpose. Additionally, Cerberus is a three-headed dog that eats the raw flesh of anyone that tries to escape, making it highly unlikely that Kit & Kaboodle could help someone past the Underworld gates.
Therefore, the final answer is No.

Disney Land is an amusement park in California. 
Disney Land occupies eighty five acres.

Question: Can the Moscow Kremlin fit inside Disney Land?
(PROMPT END)
Question: Can the Moscow Kremlin fit inside Disney Land?
Thoughts:
First, we need to compare the size of the Moscow Kremlin and Disney Land. The Kremlin takes up sixty eight acres, while Disney Land occupies eighty five acres.
However, the size comparison alone does not provide enough information to determine if the Kremlin can fit inside Disney Land. We need to consider the shape and layout of both the Kremlin and Disney Land.
The Kremlin is a fortified complex with multiple buildings and structures, while Disney Land is an amusement park with various attractions and rides. The Kremlin's layout is likely more complex and compact than Disney Land's, which may make it difficult to fit inside the park.
Additionally, the Kremlin is a historical and cultural landmark, while Disney Land is primarily an entertainment destination. The Kremlin's architecture and design may not be compatible with Disney Land's theme and style.
Therefore, based on the available information, it is unlikely that the Moscow Kremlin can fit inside Disney Land.

Facts: 
Earth orbits around the Sun in 365 days.
Napoleonic Wars lasted 12 years, 5 months and 4 weeks.

Question: Did earth complete at least one orbit around the sun during the Napoleonic Wars?
(PROMPT END)
Question: Did earth complete at least one orbit around the sun during the Napoleonic Wars?
Thoughts:
1. We know that Earth orbits around the Sun in 365 days.
2. The Napoleonic Wars lasted for 12 years, 5 months, and 4 weeks.
3. To determine if Earth completed at least one orbit around the Sun during the Napoleonic Wars, we need to calculate the total number of days in the war period.
4. We can convert the duration of the Napoleonic Wars into days by multiplying the number of years by 365 and adding the number of months and weeks.
5. 12 years x 365 days/year = 4380 days
6. 5 months x 30 days/month = 150 days
7. 4 weeks x 7 days/week = 28 days
8. Adding these values together, we get a total of 4380 + 150 + 28 = 4558 days.
9. Since Earth orbits around the Sun in 365 days, we can calculate the number of orbits completed during the Napoleonic Wars by dividing the total number of days in the war period by the length of one orbit.
10. 4558 days / 365 days/orbit = 12.000000000000001 orbits.
11. Since Earth completes at least one orbit around the Sun in a year, it is safe to say that Earth completed at least one orbit around the Sun during the Napoleonic Wars.

Now, you will be provided with the evaluation question and fact(s) below.
Facts: 
Newborn kittens are small enough to fit in an average human hand.
The average human hand is 7 inches.
An Amtrak coach seat is 39" x 23".

Question: Would three newborn kittens fit on a standard Amtrak coach seat?
(PROMPT END)
Question: Would three newborn kittens fit on a standard Amtrak coach seat?
Thoughts:
1. First, we need to determine the size of a newborn kitten. Since they are small enough to fit in an average human hand, we can assume that they are around the size of a small mouse or rat.
2. Next, we need to determine the size of an Amtrak coach seat. According to the facts provided, an Amtrak coach seat is 39" x 23".
3. To determine if three newborn kittens would fit on the seat, we need to compare their size to the seat dimensions. Since each kitten is around the size of a small mouse or rat, we can assume that they would take up approximately the same amount of space.
4. Therefore, if one small mouse or rat can fit in an average human hand, then three small mice or rats would take up three times the space of one.
5. Since the Amtrak coach seat is 39" x 23", we can calculate the total area of the seat as (39 x 23) = 917 square inches.
6. If one small mouse or rat takes up approximately 1/3 of the seat area, then three small mice or rats would take up (1/3 x 917) = 305.67 square inches.
7. Since the total area of three small mice or rats is 305.67 square inches, it is less than the total area of the Amtrak coach seat (917 square inches).
8. Therefore, three newborn kittens would fit on a standard Amtrak coach seat.
Final Answer: Yes.

Many grocery stores carry canned oysters in the shelf stable section. 

Question: Can oysters be preserved without refrigeration? 
(PROMPT END)
Question: Can oysters be preserved without refrigeration?
Thoughts:
RULE 1: The key elements of the question are "oysters" and "preservation." The fact provided is about the presence of oysters in some types of Korean kimchi and their availability in canned form in grocery stores.
RULE 2: To determine if oysters can be preserved without refrigeration, we need to consider the properties of oysters and the methods used for preservation. Oysters are a type of shellfish that can spoil quickly if not handled properly. They contain bacteria that can cause foodborne illnesses if not killed or inactivated.
RULE 3: The final answer must be consistent with the step-by-step decomposition. If oysters can be preserved without refrigeration, then it means that the methods used for preservation do not require refrigeration.
RULE 4: We need to consider the context and background knowledge to identify any implicit assumptions or constraints that may affect the reasoning process. In this case, the fact provided is about the presence of oysters in Korean kimchi and their availability in canned form in grocery stores. This suggests that the methods used for preservation may be related to these specific contexts.
RULE 5: We need to consider the relationships between the different elements of the question and the facts provided, such as causality, similarity, or contradiction. In this case, the fact provided suggests that oysters can be preserved in some types of Korean kimchi, which may imply that the methods used for preservation do not require refrigeration.
RULE 6: We need to validate inferences based on sound reasoning and ensure that the evidence supports the conclusion. To determine if oysters can be preserved without refrigeration, we need to consider the properties of oysters and the methods used for preservation. We also need to consider the context and background knowledge to identify any implicit assumptions or constraints that may affect the reasoning process.
RULE 7: We need to cross-verify reasoning steps to confirm that all parts contribute coherently to the final conclusion. If oysters can be preserved without refrigeration, then it means that the methods used for preservation do not require refrigeration. We need to consider the properties of oysters and the methods used for preservation to validate this inference.
RULE 8: We need to consider the potential impact of implicit assumptions or constraints on the reasoning process and the final answer. In this case, the fact provided suggests that the methods used for preservation may be related to the specific contexts of Korean kimchi and canned oysters in grocery stores. We need to consider these contexts to validate the inference that oysters can be preserved without refrigeration.
RULE 9: We need to consider the potential implications of each inference and how it contributes to the overall answer. If oysters can be preserved without refrigeration, then it means that the methods used for preservation do not require refrigeration. This inference contributes to the overall answer by providing a specific condition under which oysters can be preserved.
RULE 10: We need to validate inferences based on a thorough analysis of the available evidence and ensure that they are not influenced by personal biases or beliefs. To determine if oysters can be preserved without refrigeration, we need to consider the properties of oysters and the methods used for preservation. We also need to consider the context and background knowledge to identify any implicit assumptions or constraints that may affect the reasoning process.
RULE 11: We need to consider the potential sources of error or uncertainty that may affect the final answer. In this case, we need to consider the properties of oysters and the methods used for preservation to validate the inference that oysters can be preserved without refrigeration. We also need to consider the context and background knowledge to identify any implicit assumptions or constraints that may affect the reasoning process.
RULE 12: We need to consider the potential impact of implicit assumptions or constraints on the reasoning process and the final answer. In this case, the fact provided suggests that the methods used for preservation may be related to the specific contexts of Korean kimchi and canned oysters in grocery stores. We need to consider these contexts to validate the inference that oysters can be preserved without refrigeration.
RULE 13: We need to consider the potential counterarguments or alternative explanations that may challenge the reasoning process. In this case, we need to consider alternative methods for preserving oysters that may require refrigeration.
RULE 14: We need to ensure that inferences are based on a thorough analysis of the available evidence and that they are not influenced by personal biases or beliefs. To determine if oysters can be preserved without refrigeration, we need to consider the properties of oysters and the methods used for preservation. We also need to consider the context and background knowledge to identify any implicit assumptions or constraints that may affect the reasoning process.
RULE 15: We need to consider the potential limitations or gaps in the available evidence and how they may affect the final answer. In this case, we need to consider the properties of oysters and the methods used for preservation to validate the inference that oysters can be preserved without refrigeration. We also need to consider the context and background knowledge to identify any implicit assumptions or constraints that may affect the reasoning process.

(PROMPT END)
Question: Is Jesse W. Moore a potential recipient of a Snoopy-themed award from NASA?
Thoughts:
RULE 1: The key elements of the question are the potential recipient (Jesse W. Moore) and the award (Snoopy-themed award from NASA). The facts provided include the history of Snoopy as a mascot of safety in NASA, the Silver Snoopy award given by NASA astronauts, and the failure history of the O rings used on the Challenger shuttle.
RULE 2: The Silver Snoopy award is given by NASA astronauts to employees and contractors for outstanding achievements related to flight safety. The fact that Jesse W. Moore received warnings about the failure history of the O rings used on the Challenger shuttle, but did not act on them, suggests that he may not have been responsible for outstanding achievements related to flight safety.
RULE 3: The O rings were strongly implicated in the fatal explosion, which occurred during the Challenger shuttle launch. This suggests that Jesse W. Moore, as the associate administrator in charge of NASA's shuttle program at the time of the explosion, may not have been responsible for outstanding achievements related to flight safety.
RULE 4: The cultural, historical, or social context of the time period when the Challenger shuttle launched may have influenced the reasoning process. However, the available evidence suggests that Jesse W. Moore was not responsible for outstanding achievements related to flight safety.
RULE 5: The relationship between Jesse W. Moore and the Silver Snoopy award is not clear from the available evidence. However, the fact that Jesse W. Moore was not responsible for outstanding achievements related to flight safety suggests that he may not be a potential recipient of a Snoopy-themed award from NASA.
RULE 6: The inference that Jesse W. Moore may not be a potential recipient of a Snoopy-themed award from NASA is based on the available evidence and is consistent with the reasoning process.
RULE 7: The reasoning process is consistent with the overall question context and the available evidence.
RULE 8: The cultural, historical, or social context of the time period when the Challenger shuttle launched may have influenced the reasoning process. However, the available evidence suggests that Jesse W. Moore was not responsible for outstanding achievements related to flight safety.
RULE 9: The potential implications of the inference are that Jesse W. Moore may not be recognized for outstanding achievements related to flight safety and may not receive a Snoopy-themed award from NASA.
RULE 10: The inference is consistent with the available evidence and does not rely on assumptions or biases that may affect the reasoning process.
RULE 11: The potential sources of error or uncertainty that may affect the final answer are not clear from the available evidence.
RULE 12: The potential impact of implicit assumptions or constraints on the reasoning process is not clear from the available evidence.
RULE 13: The potential counterarguments or alternative explanations that may challenge the reasoning process are not clear from the available evidence.
RULE 14: The inference is based on a thorough analysis of the available evidence and is not influenced by personal biases or beliefs.
RULE 15: The potential limitations or gaps in the available evidence are not clear from the available evidence.
Final Answer: No.

Question: Would a moose hypothetically be too much for a minotaur to devour whole?
(PROMPT END)
Question: Would a moose hypothetically be too much for a minotaur to devour whole?
Thoughts:
1. First, we need to determine the size of the minotaur. Since it has the head of a bull and body of a human, we can assume that it is roughly the size of a human.
2. Next, we need to compare the size of the moose to the size of the minotaur. A moose can weigh up to 1500 pounds, while a human (and thus a minotaur) typically weighs around 150 pounds.
3. Given these sizes, it is clear that a moose would be much larger than a minotaur, and therefore, it would be impossible for a minotaur to devour a moose whole.

Now, you will be provided with the evaluation question and fact(s) below.
Facts: 
83% of blacks in the US identify as Christians.
 In the United States, blacks are less likely than other ethnic groups to be religiously unaffiliated, let alone identifying as atheist.
African American history, slavery and the civil rights movement are all closely tied to Christianity in America.

Question: Can atheism surpass Christianity in American black communities by 2021?
(PROMPT END)

Question: Can atheism surpass Christianity in American black communities by 2021?
Thoughts:
First, we need to understand the current state of religious affiliation among black Americans. According to the facts provided, 83% of blacks in the US identify as Christians. This suggests that Christianity is the dominant religion in black American communities.

Next, we need to consider the historical and cultural ties between Christianity and black American communities. The facts indicate that African American history, slavery, and the civil rights movement are all closely tied to Christianity in America. This suggests that Christianity has played a significant role in shaping the beliefs and values of black Americans.

Given these factors, it is unlikely that atheism will surpass Christianity in American black communities by 2021. While the number of atheists among black Americans may increase, the historical and cultural ties between Christianity and black American communities are likely to remain strong.

RULE 2: Using the provided facts, we can build logical connections between each step. Giant squids live between 1,000 and 3,800 feet in the ocean, which means that capturing them in natural habitat would require diving to these depths. Without scuba gear, people can safely dive a maximum of 60 feet, which is far below the depth range of giant squids.
RULE 3: The final answer must be consistent with the step-by-step decomposition. Based on the reasoning above, capturing giant squid in natural habitat without gear is impossible.
Final Answer: No.

(PROMPT END)
Question: Does New York Harbor sit on a craton without volcanic activity?
Thoughts:
1. First, we need to identify the key elements of the question and the facts provided. The question asks if New York Harbor sits on a craton without volcanic activity. The facts provided indicate that New York Harbor is located on Laurentia craton and that the southwestern portion of Laurentia contains numerous large volcanic eruptions.
2. Next, we need to build logical connections between each step. Since New York Harbor is located on Laurentia craton, it is likely that the southwestern portion of Laurentia, which contains numerous large volcanic eruptions, is also relevant to the question.
3. We can then validate that every inference aligns with the available evidence and the overall question context. Since the facts provided indicate that New York Harbor is located on Laurentia craton and that the southwestern portion of Laurentia contains numerous large volcanic eruptions, it is reasonable to conclude that New York Harbor sits on a craton with volcanic activity.
4. Finally, we need to cross-verify each reasoning step, confirming that all parts contribute coherently to the final conclusion. Our initial inference that New York Harbor sits on a craton with volcanic activity is consistent with the available evidence and the overall question context. Therefore, our final answer is No.

Metallica concerts are held in large arenas attended by tens of thousands of fans
The highest estimate for the giant panda population is around 3,000 animals

Question: Can giant pandas sell out a Metallica show?
(PROMPT END)
Question: Can giant pandas sell out a Metallica show?
Thoughts:
RULE 1: The key elements of the question are the ability of giant pandas to sell out a Metallica show. The facts provided are the size of Metallica concerts and the estimated population of giant pandas.
RULE 2: To build a logical connection between the two, we need to consider the relationship between the two elements. We can start by assuming that giant pandas have no interest in attending Metallica shows. However, this assumption may not be accurate, as giant pandas are known to be curious and adaptable animals.
RULE 3: To ensure that the final answer is consistent with the step-by-step decomposition, we need to consider the potential implications of each inference. If giant pandas were to sell out a Metallica show, it would suggest that they have a significant interest in attending such events.
RULE 4: We need to consider the context and background knowledge to identify any implicit assumptions or constraints that may affect the reasoning process. In this case, we can assume that giant pandas are not known for their interest in heavy metal music.
RULE 5: We need to consider the relationships between the different elements of the question and the facts provided, such as causality, similarity, or contradiction. In this case, we can assume that the size of the Metallica concert and the estimated population of giant pandas are not directly related.
RULE 6: We need to ensure that the inferences are based on sound reasoning and that the evidence supports the conclusion. In this case, we can assume that the available evidence is not sufficient to determine whether giant pandas can sell out a Metallica show.
RULE 7: We need to cross-verify the reasoning steps to confirm that all parts contribute coherently to the final conclusion. In this case, we can assume that the available evidence is not sufficient to determine whether giant pandas can sell out a Metallica show.
RULE 8: We need to consider the potential impact of implicit assumptions or constraints on the reasoning process and the final answer. In this case, we can assume that the available evidence is not sufficient to determine whether giant pandas can sell out a Metallica show.
RULE 9: We need to consider the potential implications of each inference and how it contributes to the overall answer. In this case, we can assume that the available evidence is not sufficient to determine whether giant pandas can sell out a Metallica show.
RULE 10: We need to ensure that the inferences are consistent with the available evidence and that they do not rely on assumptions or biases that may affect the reasoning process. In this case, we can assume that the available evidence is not sufficient to determine whether giant pandas can sell out a Metallica show.
RULE 11: We need to consider the potential sources of error or uncertainty that may affect the final answer. In this case, we can assume that the available evidence is not sufficient to determine whether giant pandas can sell out a Metallica show.

(PROMPT END)
Question: Would a teacher still have their job if they called a black student an ape?
Thoughts:
RULE 1: The key elements of the question are the action of the teacher (calling a black student an ape) and the potential consequence (losing their job). The facts provided are related to the derogatory use of the words 'ape' and 'monkey' against black people and the professionalism expected of teachers.
RULE 2: The use of the word 'ape' as a derogatory term against black people is a fact. The professionalism expected of teachers is also a fact. Therefore, calling a black student an ape would likely be considered abusive and unprofessional.
RULE 3: The final answer must be consistent with the step-by-step decomposition. If calling a black student an ape is considered abusive and unprofessional, then a teacher who does so would likely lose their job.
RULE 4: The cultural and historical context of the use of the word 'ape' as a derogatory term against black people may affect the reasoning process. However, the professionalism expected of teachers is a universal standard that transcends cultural and historical contexts.
RULE 5: The relationship between the use of the word 'ape' as a derogatory term and the professionalism expected of teachers is one of contradiction. Using the word 'ape' in an abusive manner is unprofessional and goes against the expectations of teachers.
RULE 6: The inference that a teacher who calls a black student an ape would lose their job is based on sound reasoning and is supported by the available evidence.
RULE 7: The final answer must be consistent with the step-by-step decomposition and the available evidence. If calling a black student an ape is considered abusive and unprofessional, then a teacher who does so would likely lose their job.
RULE 8: The cultural, historical, or social context that may influence the reasoning process is not relevant in this case, as the professionalism expected of teachers is a universal standard.
RULE 9: The potential implications of each inference are that calling a black student an ape is abusive and unprofessional, and that a teacher who does so would likely lose their job. These implications contribute to the overall answer.
RULE 10: The inference that a teacher who calls a black student an ape would lose their job is consistent with the available evidence and does not rely on assumptions or biases that may affect the reasoning process.
RULE 11: The potential sources of error or uncertainty that may affect the final answer are not relevant in this case, as the professionalism expected of teachers is a universal standard.
RULE 12: The potential impact of implicit assumptions or constraints on the reasoning process is not relevant in this case, as the professionalism expected of teachers is a universal standard.
RULE 13: The potential counterarguments or alternative explanations that may challenge the reasoning process are not relevant in this case, as the professionalism expected of teachers is a universal standard.
RULE 14: The inference that a teacher who calls a black student an ape would lose their job is based on a thorough analysis of the available evidence and is not influenced by personal biases or beliefs.
RULE 15: The potential limitations or gaps in the available evidence that may affect the final answer are not relevant in this case, as the professionalism expected of teachers is a universal standard.

(PROMPT END)
Question: Could an ocelot outrun a kindergartner?
Thoughts:
1. First, we need to determine the speed of a kindergartner. Since human children under 10 are not likely to exceed 20 kilometers per hour, we can assume that a kindergartner would run at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour or less.
2. Next, we need to compare the speed of an ocelot (61 kilometers per hour) to the speed of a kindergartner (20 kilometers per hour or less).
3. Since the speed of an ocelot is significantly higher than the speed of a kindergartner, we can conclude that an ocelot could easily outrun a kindergartner.

Question: Could Javier Sotomayor jump over the head of the average giraffe?
(PROMPT END)
Question: Could Javier Sotomayor jump over the head of the average giraffe?
Thoughts:
1. First, we need to determine the average height of a giraffe. Since fully grown giraffes stand 4.3–5.7 m (14.1–18.7 ft) tall, we can assume that the average height of a giraffe is around (4.3+5.7)/2 = 4.95 m (16.25 ft).
2. Next, we need to compare Javier Sotomayor's personal best long jump of 2.45 m (8 ft 1/2 in) with the average height of a giraffe.
3. To determine if Javier Sotomayor could jump over the head of the average giraffe, we need to ensure that his long jump is greater than the average height of a giraffe.
4. Since 2.45 m (8 ft 1/2 in) is less than 4.95 m (16.25 ft), Javier Sotomayor could not jump over the head of the average giraffe.

Question: Would Iris (mythology) and Hermes hypothetically struggle at a UPS job?
(PROMPT END)
Question: Would Iris (mythology) and Hermes hypothetically struggle at a UPS job?
Thoughts:
First, we need to identify the key elements of the question and the facts provided. The question asks whether Iris and Hermes would struggle at a UPS job. The facts provided are about UPS being the number one delivery/courier service in 2019 and the roles of Iris and Hermes in Greek mythology.

Next, we need to build logical connections between each step, validating that every inference aligns with the available evidence and the overall question context. To do this, we can consider the roles of Iris and Hermes in Greek mythology and how they relate to the job of a delivery/courier service. Iris is a goddess of the rainbow and serves as a messenger of the gods, while Hermes is a god that functions as the emissary and messenger of the gods. Both Iris and Hermes are messengers, which suggests that they may have the necessary skills to work at a delivery/courier service.

However, we also need to consider the context of the UPS job. The fact that UPS is the number one delivery/courier service in 2019 suggests that the job requires a high level of efficiency, accuracy, and speed. Iris and Hermes may struggle with these requirements, as they are mythological figures and do not have the same level of experience or training as modern delivery/courier service workers.

Therefore, based on the available evidence and the overall question context, it is likely that Iris and Hermes would struggle at a UPS job.

Now, you will be provided with the evaluation question and fact(s) below.
Facts: 
A banana tree has seeds that only have one embryonic leaf and is called a monocot.
Judges use gavels to maintain order in court.
Gavels are made of hardwood.
Hardwood comes from dicot trees.
Oak, maple, and sycamore are dicot trees.

Question: Are banana trees used by judges for maintaining order?
(PROMPT END)
Question: Are banana trees used by judges for maintaining order?
Thoughts:
1. First, we need to understand the relationship between banana trees and dicot trees. Since hardwood, which gavels are made of, comes from dicot trees, we can conclude that banana trees, which are monocots, are not the source of hardwood.
2. Next, we need to consider the role of judges in maintaining order. Judges use gavels to maintain order in court, but gavels are made of hardwood, which comes from dicot trees.
3. Since banana trees are not the source of hardwood, we can conclude that banana trees are not used by judges for maintaining order.

2. We know that Yin and Yang are a philosophical Chinese concept represented by the color black and white.
3. Black and white when mixed together create the color gray.
4. The rainbow contains the colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.
5. To determine if rainbows are devoid of color made by mixing yin and yang colors, we need to check if the colors in the rainbow can be created by mixing black and white.
6. We can see that the colors in the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet) cannot be created by mixing black and white.
7. Therefore, rainbows are not devoid of color made by mixing yin and yang colors.

Question: Can citrus grow in Ulaanbaatar?
(PROMPT END)
Question: Can citrus grow in Ulaanbaatar?
Thoughts:
Based on the provided facts, we can start by identifying the key elements of the question: whether citrus can grow in Ulaanbaatar. We can then use the available facts to build logical connections between each step.
First, we know that citrus can withstand short periods down to as cold as −10 °C (14 °F). However, realistically temperatures not falling below −2 °C (28 °F) are required for successful cultivation.
Next, we consider the average annual temperature in Ulaanbaatar, which is −0.4 °C or 31.3 °F. Comparing this temperature to the required temperature for successful citrus cultivation, we see that Ulaanbaatar's average annual temperature is below the minimum temperature required for successful citrus cultivation.
Therefore, based on the available facts, we can conclude that citrus cannot grow in Ulaanbaatar.

Thoughts:
First, we need to identify the key elements of the question and the facts provided. The question is about whether Brian Warner would be a good singer for a soul music band. The facts provided are about the origin of soul music and the genre of Marilyn Manson's music.

Next, we need to build logical connections between each step. We know that soul music originated in the United States African American community and combines elements of gospel music, rhythm and blues, and jazz. Therefore, it is unlikely that Brian Warner, who is the lead singer of a band that plays industrial heavy metal music, would be a good fit for a soul music band.

Finally, we need to validate our inference by cross-verifying each reasoning step. We have identified the key elements of the question and built logical connections between each step. Our final answer is No, Brian Warner would not be a good singer for a soul music band.

Now, you will be provided with the evaluation question and fact(s) below.
Facts: 
Athena was the Greek goddess of war.
Aphrodite was the Greek goddess of love.
Freya was the Norse goddess of war, love, and fertility.

Question: Is Freya a combination of Athena and Aphrodite?
(PROMPT END)
Question: Is Freya a combination of Athena and Aphrodite?
Thoughts:
First, we need to identify the key elements of the question and the facts provided. The question asks if Freya is a combination of Athena and Aphrodite. The facts provided are that Athena is the Greek goddess of war, Aphrodite is the Greek goddess of love, and Freya is the Norse goddess of war, love, and fertility.
Next, we need to build logical connections between each step, validating that every inference aligns with the available evidence and the overall question context. To do this, we can compare the attributes of Freya with those of Athena and Aphrodite. Freya is the Norse goddess of war, love, and fertility, which are similar to the attributes of Athena and Aphrodite. However, Freya is also a Norse goddess, which is different from Athena and Aphrodite being Greek goddesses. Therefore, Freya cannot be a combination of Athena and Aphrodite.
Finally, we need to cross-verify each reasoning step, confirming that all parts contribute coherently to the final conclusion. We have compared the attributes of Freya with those of Athena and Aphrodite and found that they are similar but different. Therefore, Freya cannot be a combination of Athena and Aphrodite.
Final Answer: No.

Now, you will be provided with the evaluation question and fact(s) below.
Facts: 
A false pope, or antipope, is someone that tries to claim they are the true pope but the church rejects them.
Hippolytus (c. 170–235 AD) headed a schismatic group as a rival to the Bishop of Rome, thus becoming an antipope.
Hippolytus (c. 170–235 AD) was named a saint in the Roman Catholic Church.

Question: Can a false pope become a saint?
(PROMPT END)

Question: Can a false pope become a saint?
Thoughts:
1. First, we need to understand the concept of a false pope. A false pope is someone who claims to be the true pope but is rejected by the church.
2. Next, we need to consider the fact that Hippolytus (c. 170–235 AD) was an antipope. This means that he claimed to be the true pope but was rejected by the church.
3. Despite being an antipope, Hippolytus was later named a saint in the Roman Catholic Church. This raises the question of whether a false pope can become a saint.
4. To answer this question, we need to consider the criteria for sainthood in the Roman Catholic Church. According to the church, a person can be canonized as a saint if they have performed a miracle.
5. However, the fact that Hippolytus was an antipope raises a potential issue with the criteria for sainthood. If a false pope can perform a miracle, does this mean that they are truly a saint?
6. To resolve this issue, we need to consider the context in which Hippolytus performed his miracle. It is possible that Hippolytus's miracle was performed before he became an antipope, or that it was performed after he was excommunicated by the church.
7. If Hippolytus's miracle was performed before he became an antipope, then it is possible that he was truly a saint. However, if his miracle was performed after he was excommunicated by the church, then it is less clear whether he was truly a saint.
8. Ultimately, the question of whether a false pope can become a saint is a complex one that requires careful consideration of the available evidence and the criteria for sainthood in the Roman Catholic Church.

Final Answer: No, a false pope cannot become a saint.

Chess is a game that is made up of 64 squares.
The Japanese game of Shogi requires a total of 81 squares.

Question: Can a chess board be converted to a Shogi board?
(PROMPT END)
Question: Can a chess board be converted to a Shogi board?
Thoughts:
1. The first step is to identify the key elements of the question and the facts provided. In this case, the key elements are the chess board and the Shogi board, and the fact provided is that Shogi requires a total of 81 squares.
2. The next step is to build logical connections between the elements of the question and the facts provided. To do this, we need to consider the relationship between the number of squares on a chess board and the number of squares on a Shogi board.
3. We know that a chess board has 64 squares, and a Shogi board has 81 squares. The difference between these two numbers is 17 (81 - 64 = 17).
4. To convert a chess board to a Shogi board, we need to add 17 squares to the chess board. This means that we need to add 17 squares to each side of the chess board.
5. The final step is to cross-verify the reasoning process and ensure that the final answer is consistent with the step-by-step decomposition. In this case, the final answer is "No," because it is not possible to add 17 squares to each side of a chess board to create a Shogi board.
Final Answer: No.

Thoughts:
The 1700s judges' attire may be considered adornment, which is prohibited by the Bible according to 1 Timothy 2:8-9. However, the beliefs of Orthodox Presbyterians regarding adornment are not explicitly stated. Therefore, we need to consider other factors that may affect the reasoning process.

The cultural and historical context of the 1700s may influence the reasoning process. For example, the judges' attire may have been considered a symbol of power and authority during that time. Additionally, the beliefs of Orthodox Presbyterians may have evolved over time, and their interpretation of the Bible may have changed.

The relationship between the attire of 1700s judges and the beliefs of Orthodox Presbyterians is not explicitly stated. Therefore, we need to consider other factors that may affect the reasoning process.

The evidence provided does not directly support the conclusion. The Bible verse warns against adorning oneself with objects, but it does not explicitly mention judges' attire.

The reasoning steps must be cross-verified to ensure consistency and coherence. The final answer must be consistent with the step-by-step decomposition.

The cultural, historical, or social context that may influence the reasoning process is not explicitly stated. Therefore, we need to consider other factors that may affect the reasoning process.

Question: Will speed reader devour The Great Gatsby before the Raven?
Thoughts:
1. The first step is to identify the key elements of the question and the facts provided. In this case, the key elements are the speed reader's ability to read, the length of The Great Gatsby and The Raven, and the order in which they will be read.
2. Using the provided facts, we can build logical connections between each step. The speed reader's ability to read will determine how quickly they can consume the two books. The length of each book will affect the time required to read them. Therefore, we can conclude that the speed reader will read The Great Gatsby first since it is longer than The Raven.
3. To validate this inference, we can cross-verify each reasoning step. The speed reader's ability to read is a given fact, and the length of each book is also provided. Therefore, the inference that the speed reader will read The Great Gatsby first is consistent with the available evidence and the overall question context.
4. When decomposing the question, we can identify implicit assumptions or constraints that may affect the reasoning process. In this case, there are no significant assumptions or constraints that may influence the reasoning process.
5. When building logical connections between steps, we can consider the relationships between the different elements of the question and the facts provided. In this case, the relationship between the speed reader's ability to read and the length of each book is causal.
6. When validating inferences, we can ensure that they are based on sound reasoning and that the evidence supports the conclusion. In this case, the inference that the speed reader will read The Great Gatsby first is based on sound reasoning and is supported by the provided facts.
7. When cross-verifying reasoning steps, we can check for consistency and coherence with the overall question context and the available evidence. In this case, the inference that the speed reader will read The Great Gatsby first is consistent with the available evidence and the overall question context.
8. When identifying implicit assumptions or constraints, we can consider the cultural, historical, or social context that may influence the reasoning process. In this case, there are no significant cultural, historical, or social factors that may affect the reasoning process.
9. When building logical connections, we can consider the potential implications of each inference and how it contributes to the overall answer. In this case, the inference that the speed reader will read The Great Gatsby first contributes to the overall answer by providing a clear order in which the two books will be read.
10. When validating inferences, we can ensure that they are consistent with the available evidence and that they do not rely on assumptions or biases that may affect the reasoning process. In this case, the inference that the speed reader will read The Great Gatsby first is consistent with the available evidence and does not rely on any assumptions or biases.
11. When cross-verifying reasoning steps, we can consider the potential sources of error or uncertainty that may affect the final answer. In this case, there are no significant sources of error or uncertainty that may affect the final answer.
12. When identifying implicit assumptions or constraints, we can consider the potential impact of these factors on the reasoning process and the final answer. In this case, there are no significant implicit assumptions or constraints that may affect the reasoning process or the final answer.
13. When building logical connections, we can consider the potential counterarguments or alternative explanations that may challenge the reasoning process. In this case, there are no significant counterarguments or alternative explanations that may challenge the reasoning process.
14. When validating inferences, we can ensure that they are based on a thorough analysis of the available evidence and that they are not influenced by personal biases or beliefs. In this case, the inference that the speed reader will read The Great Gatsby first is based on a thorough analysis of the available evidence and is not influenced by personal biases or beliefs.
15. When cross-verifying reasoning steps, we can consider the potential limitations or gaps in the available evidence and how they may affect the final answer. In this case, there are no significant limitations or gaps in the available evidence that may affect the final answer.

Question: Is it foolish to stand on giraffe's head to see over Eiffel Tower?
(PROMPT END)
Question: Is it foolish to stand on giraffe's head to see over Eiffel Tower?
Thoughts:
1. First, we need to determine the height of a giraffe's head. Since the neck of a giraffe can be up to 7 feet in length, we can assume that the head is approximately the same height.
2. The total height of a giraffe, including their neck, can be as tall as 20 feet. Therefore, the height of the giraffe's head is 20 feet - 7 feet (the length of the neck) = 13 feet.
3. The Eiffel Tower is 1,063 feet tall. To determine if it is possible to see over the Eiffel Tower by standing on a giraffe's head, we need to compare the height of the giraffe's head to the height of the Eiffel Tower.
4. Since the height of the giraffe's head is 13 feet and the height of the Eiffel Tower is 1,063 feet, it is not possible to see over the Eiffel Tower by standing on a giraffe's head.

Now, you will be provided with the evaluation question and fact(s) below.
Facts: 
In 1967, Schwarzenegger won the Munich stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254 kg / 560 lb) is lifted between the legs while standing on two footrests.
Red foxes weigh between 2.2–14 kg (5–31 lb).

Question: Would Arnold Schwarzenegger have a hard time picking up a red fox in 1967?
(PROMPT END)

Question: Would Arnold Schwarzenegger have a hard time picking up a red fox in 1967?
Thoughts:
RULE 1: The key elements of the question are the ability of Arnold Schwarzenegger to lift a red fox in 1967. The facts provided are the weight of Schwarzenegger in 1967 and the weight range of red foxes.
RULE 2: Schwarzenegger won the Munich stone-lifting contest in 1967, which involved lifting a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254 kg / 560 lb). Red foxes weigh between 2.2–14 kg (5–31 lb). Therefore, Schwarzenegger's ability to lift a red fox in 1967 would depend on the weight of the red fox.
RULE 3: To determine if Schwarzenegger would have a hard time picking up a red fox in 1967, we need to compare the weight of the red fox to Schwarzenegger's ability to lift the stone in the Munich contest.
RULE 4: The weight of the red fox is not provided in the facts, so we need to make an assumption based on the weight range of red foxes.
RULE 5: We can assume that the weight of the red fox is within the range of 2.2–14 kg (5–31 lb).
RULE 6: To validate our assumption, we can compare the weight of the red fox to the weight of the stone in the Munich contest. The weight of the stone is 508 German pounds (254 kg / 560 lb), which is significantly heavier than the weight range of red foxes.
RULE 7: To cross-verify our reasoning, we can compare the weight of the red fox to Schwarzenegger's ability to lift the stone in the Munich contest. The weight of the stone is significantly heavier than the weight range of red foxes, so Schwarzenegger would have a hard time picking up a red fox in 1967.
RULE 8: We do not need to consider any implicit assumptions or constraints in this case.
RULE 9: The potential implications of our inference are that Schwarzenegger's ability to lift a red fox in 1967 would depend on the weight of the red fox, which is within the range of 2.2–14 kg (5–31 lb).
RULE 10: Our inference is consistent with the available evidence and does not rely on any assumptions or biases.
RULE 11: We do not need to consider any potential sources of error or uncertainty in this case.
RULE 12: We do not need to consider any potential impact of implicit assumptions or constraints in this case.
RULE 13: We do not need to consider any potential counterarguments or alternative explanations in this case.
RULE 14: Our inference is based on a thorough analysis of the available evidence and is not influenced by personal biases or beliefs.
RULE 15: We do not need to consider any potential limitations or gaps in the available evidence in this case.

Facts: 
Jon Brower Minnoch was the heaviest human being ever recorded.
At his peak weight, Jon Brower Minnoch weighed almost 1.400 lb.
The launch mass of Voyager 2 was 1,820 lb.

Question: Would Jon Brower Minnoch break a chair before Voyager 2 launch mass?
(PROMPT END)
Question: Would Jon Brower Minnoch break a chair before Voyager 2 launch mass?
Thoughts:
To answer this question, we need to compare the weight of Jon Brower Minnoch with the launch mass of Voyager 2.
First, we know that Jon Brower Minnoch weighed almost 1.400 lb.
Next, we know that the launch mass of Voyager 2 was 1,820 lb.
Comparing these two values, we can see that Jon Brower Minnoch's weight is significantly less than the launch mass of Voyager 2.
Therefore, it is unlikely that Jon Brower Minnoch would break a chair before Voyager 2 launch mass.
Final Answer: No.

Question: Can a cell fit inside of a shoebox?
(PROMPT END)
Question: Can a cell fit inside of a shoebox?
Thoughts:
First, we need to compare the size of a shoebox and an eukaryotic cell. The average shoebox is around 14 inches by 10 inches by 5 inches, while the average eukaryotic cell is between 1 and 100 micrometers in diameter.
To determine if a cell can fit inside of a shoebox, we need to consider the relative sizes of these two objects. We can use the concept of scale to help us understand this relationship.
Since the shoebox is much larger than the eukaryotic cell, it is unlikely that a cell could fit inside of a shoebox. In fact, the size difference between the two objects is so great that it is not even possible to compare their sizes directly.
Therefore, the final answer is no.

Now, you will be provided with the evaluation question and fact(s) below.
Facts: 
Secretaries are required to type and also read copious amounts of notes.
Tange Sazen is a one-eyed, one-armed swordsman in Japanese literature.

Question: Is Tange Sazen hypothetically an ideal choice for a secretary job?
(PROMPT END)
Question: Is Tange Sazen hypothetically an ideal choice for a secretary job?
Thoughts:
First, we need to identify the key elements of the question and the facts provided. The question asks if Tange Sazen is an ideal choice for a secretary job. The facts provided mention that Tange Sazen is a one-eyed, one-armed swordsman in Japanese literature, and secretaries are required to type and read copious amounts of notes.

Next, we need to build logical connections between each step. We can start by considering the skills required for a secretary job. Secretaries are required to type and read copious amounts of notes, which suggests that they need good typing and reading skills. Tange Sazen, being a one-eyed, one-armed swordsman, does not possess these skills. Therefore, it is unlikely that Tange Sazen would be an ideal choice for a secretary job.

However, we also need to consider the context and background knowledge of the question. In Japanese literature, Tange Sazen is known for his strength, bravery, and determination. These qualities may be relevant to the secretary job, as secretaries often need to be organized, detail-oriented, and able to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.

Finally, we need to validate our inference by cross-verifying each reasoning step. We have identified that Tange Sazen does not possess the necessary typing and reading skills for a secretary job. We have also considered the context and background knowledge of the question, but we have not found any evidence to suggest that Tange Sazen's qualities are relevant to the secretary job. Therefore, our final answer is no.

Final Answer: No.

Question: Will AC/DC album sales buy more B-52 bombers than Lil Wayne's?
(PROMPT END)
Question: Will AC/DC album sales buy more B-52 bombers than Lil Wayne's?
Thoughts:
To answer this question, we need to compare the cost of a B-52 bomber to the revenue generated by AC/DC and Lil Wayne's album sales.
First, we need to convert the cost of a B-52 bomber from 2018 dollars to the same currency as AC/DC and Lil Wayne's album sales. Assuming the same currency, we can compare the revenue generated by AC/DC and Lil Wayne's album sales to the cost of a B-52 bomber.
If AC/DC's revenue is greater than the cost of a B-52 bomber, then AC/DC's album sales will buy more B-52 bombers than Lil Wayne's.
If Lil Wayne's revenue is greater than the cost of a B-52 bomber, then Lil Wayne's album sales will buy more B-52 bombers than AC/DC's.
Therefore, we need to compare the revenue generated by AC/DC and Lil Wayne's album sales to the cost of a B-52 bomber.

RULE 1: The key elements of the question are the appropriateness of a model to star in a LA Femme Nikita remake. The facts provided include information about the beauty and height of models, as well as the modeling work done by Peta Wilson and Maggie Q.
RULE 2: Using the provided facts, we can build a logical connection between the beauty and height of models and their potential suitability for the role of Nikita. We can also connect the modeling work done by Peta Wilson and Maggie Q to their potential ability to portray the character.
RULE 3: Cross-verifying the reasoning steps, we can confirm that the beauty and height of models are relevant to the question and that the modeling work done by Peta Wilson and Maggie Q supports their potential suitability for the role.
RULE 4: Considering the context and background knowledge, we can identify implicit assumptions or constraints that may affect the reasoning process, such as the expectation that models should be physically fit and agile to perform the stunts and action scenes required in the film.
RULE 5: Building logical connections between steps, we can consider the relationships between the different elements of the question and the facts provided, such as the potential conflict between the beauty and height of models and their ability to perform the physical demands of the role.
RULE 6: Validating inferences, we can ensure that they are based on sound reasoning and that the evidence supports the conclusion. In this case, the evidence suggests that models may not be the most suitable choice for the role of Nikita due to their potential lack of physical fitness and agility.
RULE 7: Cross-verifying reasoning steps, we can check for consistency and coherence with the overall question context and the available evidence. In this case, the reasoning steps are consistent with the overall question context and the available evidence.
RULE 8: Considering the cultural, historical, or social context that may influence the reasoning process, we can identify potential implicit assumptions or constraints that may affect the reasoning process, such as the expectation that models should be physically fit and agile to perform the stunts and action scenes required in the film.
RULE 9: Building logical connections, we can consider the potential implications of each inference and how it contributes to the overall answer. In this case, the inference that models may not be the most suitable choice for the role of Nikita contributes to the overall answer by providing a logical and coherent explanation for why a model may not be appropriate to star in a LA Femme Nikita remake.
RULE 10: Validating inferences, we can ensure that they are consistent with the available evidence and that they do not rely on assumptions or biases that may affect the reasoning process. In this case, the inference that models may not be the most suitable choice for the role of Nikita is consistent with the available evidence and does not rely on assumptions or biases.
RULE 11: When considering potential sources of error or uncertainty that may affect the final answer, we can identify potential limitations or gaps in the available evidence and how they may affect the final answer. In this case, there may be limitations or gaps in the available evidence regarding the physical demands of the role and the ability of models to perform these demands.
RULE 12: When considering potential implicit assumptions or constraints, we can consider the potential impact of these factors on the reasoning process and the final answer. In this case, the expectation that models should be physically fit and agile to perform the stunts and action scenes required in the film may be an implicit assumption or constraint that affects the reasoning process and the final answer.
RULE 13: When building logical connections, we can consider the potential counterarguments or alternative explanations that may challenge the reasoning process. In this case, there may be counterarguments or alternative explanations that challenge the assumption that models may not be the most suitable choice for the role of Nikita, such as the argument that models may be able to train and develop the necessary physical fitness and agility to perform the stunts and action scenes required in the film.
RULE 14: When validating inferences, we can ensure that they are based on a thorough analysis of the available evidence and that they are not influenced by personal biases or beliefs. In this case, the inference that models may not be the most suitable choice for the role of Nikita is based on a thorough analysis of the available evidence and is not influenced by personal biases or beliefs.
RULE 15: When cross-verifying reasoning steps, we can consider the potential limitations or gaps in the available evidence and how they may affect the final answer. In this case, there may be limitations or gaps in the available evidence regarding the physical demands of the role and the ability of models to perform these demands, which may affect the final answer.
