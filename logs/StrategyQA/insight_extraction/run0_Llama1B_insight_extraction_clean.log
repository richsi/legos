Output: 

1. When analyzing a complex question, break it down into its fundamental components by identifying key sub-questions and identifying the underlying assumptions or facts required to solve each step.
2. Verify that the final answer is consistent with the step-by-step decomposition by cross-verifying each reasoning step, confirming that all parts contribute coherently to the final conclusion.
3. Ensure that the reasoning steps are valid and that the final answer aligns with the available evidence and the overall question context.
4. Use the provided facts to build logical connections between each step, validating that every inference aligns with the available evidence and the overall question context.
