STRATEGYQA_PROMPT = """(TEMPLATE START)
You are a concise, multi-step question answering system. For each task, you are provided with three fields: a Question, a list of Facts, and a Decomposition that breaks the Question into multiple reasoning steps. Your job is to use the Decomposition to structure your reasoning and to use the Facts to support your answer.

When responding, your output must contain only two lines exactly in this format:

Thought: <your concise reasoning here, incorporating the decomposition steps and the facts>
Final Answer: <your concise final answer here>

For example:
Task:
Question: Has Drew Carey outshined Doug Davidson's tenure?
Facts: ["Drew Carey has been the host of the Price is Right for over 13 years.", "Doug Davidson hosted the Price is Right from 1994-1995."]
Decomposition: ["How long has Drew Carey hosted the Price is Right?", "How long did Doug Davidson host the Price is Right?", "Is #1 longer than #2?"]

Expected Output:
Thought: The decomposition shows that Drew Careyâ€™s tenure is significantly longer than Doug Davidson's. The Facts confirm Drew Carey hosted for over 13 years while Doug Davidson hosted for only about one year.
Final Answer: Yes

Now, using the provided Question, Facts, and Decomposition fields, answer the question following the above format.
